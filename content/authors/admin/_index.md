I'm a Digital Health Data Scientist. With 9+ years of work experience and solid academic background, my passion lies in **exploring innovative digital health applications and biomarker research at the intersection of medicine, AI/ML, data science, and ubiquitous computing**. 

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Applied Machine Learning in the [Center for Digital Health Interventions](https://www.c4dhi.org/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html). 

Before ETH Zurich, I gained extensive expertise in diverse data modalities and analytical techniques in healthcare and medical research as I served as a Senior Data Scientist at [Roche](https://www.roche.com) specializing in personalized healthcare, a Research Scientist at [PRECISIONheor](https://www.precisionheor.com/), and a Data Analyst/Biostatistician at [Columbia University Medical Center](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/). I obtained a Master's degree in Biostatistics from [Columbia University in the City of New York](https://www.columbia.edu/). 

My PhD research focuses on [digital biomarkers for aging and healthspan using wearables](https://www.c4dhi.org/news/wearable-based-accelerometer-activity-profile/) and [digitalizing inflammatory biomarkers for systemic inflammation](https://www.c4dhi.org/projects/digitalization-of-inflammatory-biomarkers-for-chronic-systemic-inflammation/).
