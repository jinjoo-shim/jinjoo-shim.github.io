* NOn-inVAsive, multi-modal inflammatory biomarker discovery for systemic inflammation: A feasibility study protocol (NOVA Study), *(Under review)*

Several studies have shown robust evidence between the chronic systemic inflammation (SI) and increasing risks of mortality and various non-communicable diseases, including hypertension, hyperglycemia, type II diabetes, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, several types of malignancies, depression and sarcopenia. 

The C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α) provide valuable insights on inflammatory activity of SI. Current gold standard detection relies on blood and serum samples, which are semi-invasive and burdensome to patients, the procedure is costly and requires trained personnel, and the real-time monitoring or at-home measurements is not feasible. 

A non-invasive, digital inflammatory biomarker would help alleviate multiple burdens from invasive blood tests and contribute to the self-management of patients. Furthermore, it would add significant value to clinicians and caregivers by enabling meaningful treatment and effective prevention of future events. To this end, this project aims to investigate to what extent biomarkers indicating the presence of health-damaging chronic inflammation can be measured non-invasively and digitized.
