I invovled in research projects addressing the unmet needs of individuals with rare cancer subtypes or those in vulnerable populations where conducting clinical trials is not feasible. Utilizing multi-modal real-world databases, including electronic health records (EHR), clinico-genomic databases, and survey data, I informed therapeutic strategies, assessed comparative treatment effectiveness, patient-oriented outcomes, and complemented clinical trials.
