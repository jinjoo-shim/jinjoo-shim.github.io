              To explore the effect of apps measuring patient-reported outcomes (PROs) on patient‚Äìprovider interaction in the rheumatic diseases in an observational setting.
            
            
              Methods
              Patients in the Swiss Clinical Quality Management in Rheumatic Diseases Registry were offered mobile apps (iDialog and COmPASS) to track disease status between rheumatology visits using validated PROs (Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index-5 score, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index score, Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data-3 score and Visual Analogue Scale score for pain, disease activity and skin symptoms). We assessed two aspects of patient‚Äìprovider interaction: shared decision making (SDM) and physician awareness of disease fluctuations. We used logistic regressions to compare outcomes among patients who (1) used an app and discussed app data with their physician (app+discussion group), (2) used an app without discussing the data (app-only group) or (3) did not use any app (non-app users).
            
            
              Results
              2111 patients were analysed, including 1799 non-app users, 150 app-only users and 162 app+discussion users (43\% male; with 902 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 766 patients with axial spondyloarthritis and 443 patients with psoriatic arthritis). App users were younger than non-app users (mean age of 47 vs 51 years, p{\textless}0.001). Compared with non-app users, the app+discussion group rated their rheumatologist more highly in SDM (OR 1.7, 95\% CI 1.1 to 2.4) and physician awareness of disease fluctuations (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.3 to 3.1). This improvement was absent in the app-only group.
            
            
              Conclusion
              App users who discussed app data with their rheumatologist reported more favourably on patient‚Äìprovider interactions than app users who did not and non-app users. Apps measuring PROs may contribute little to patient‚Äìprovider interactions without integration of app data into care processes.},

              Objectives
              Electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) transmitted digitally allow patients to communicate with their clinicians and track the activity of chronic diseases, such as RA. Several ePRO smartphone apps have been developed in rheumatology, yet few data have been reported regarding patient adherence. We developed a PRO app for RA and assessed adherence over 6‚Äâmonths.
            
            
              Methods
              We developed an app to deliver daily assessments to participants (RA App v.1.0). The app was tested as part of a randomized controlled trial examining potential clinical benefits. The current analyses focus on the adherence to the ePRO app for patients randomized to receive the app. We recruited RA patients from an academic rheumatology practice in the USA. Patients randomized to receive the app received daily notifications regarding ePROs. We examined adherence to the PRO questionnaires over the 6-month study and examined factors related to adherence.
            
            
              Results
              Seventy-eight patients received the app and have data included in these analyses: 63 (80.7\%) were female, mean age was 55.2‚Äâyears, 71\% had attended college or beyond, and the mean Clinical Disease Activity Index at baseline was 9.7 (low disease activity). Median adherence to the daily questions was 79\% (interquartile range 48‚Äì90\%). Significant predictors of increased adherence were age ‚â•65 (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.03) and low baseline Clinical Disease Activity Index (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.02).
            
            
              Conclusion
              We developed and tested an ePRO app for RA over a 6-month study. Adherence to the app was strong. There was correlation between older age and better disease control and increased adherence.

              Background
              Rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) are associated with depression, fatigue, and disturbed sleep ‚Äì symptoms that often impact behavior and activity. Patient reported outcomes (PROs) are a way of collecting information on the patient symptom experience directly from the individual. The purpose of this study was to measure and compare user smartphone sensor and activity data in adults with RMDs and assess associations with PROs.
            
            
              Methods
              We invited adults with RMDs enrolled in the FORWARD Databank to participate by installing a custom app on their smartphone and answering PROs (pain, global, HAQ-II) questions daily and weekly over 3 years. Passive data collected included mobility distance, unique calls and text messages, call durations, and number of missed calls. Confounders included sociodemographic, clinical, passive phone behavior, and seasonal factors. Kappa statistics between PRO and flares were computed to measure agreement. The agreement between daily and weekly VAS pain was estimated using the intraclass (ICC) correlation of a two-way random effect model. The relationship between the weekly PRO outcomes and the passive phone data was analyzed with a linear mixed-effect model (LMM), including a random intercept for participant and slope for time in the study with an unstructured covariate structure.
            
            
              Results
              Of the 446 participants, the mean (SD) age was 54 (12) years, most (65.5\%) had rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the vast majority (91\%) were female, and the US Northeast has the least representation (12\%). Longer reaction times, interaction diversity, and higher mobility were associated with worse PROs while longer text messages were associated with better PROs. Participants in this study showed good levels of adherence which holds promise for future interventions using passive behavior measures in self-management and clinical follow-up.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This is the first study to examine passive smartphone behavior with PROs in RMDs and we found significant associations between these behaviors and important health outcomes of pain and function. As smartphone usage continues to change, future studies should validate and expand on our findings with a goal of finding changes in patient symptoms passively through mobile device monitoring.},

	abstract = {Background: The US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Physical Activity Monitor (PAM) data for 2011‚Äì2014 were recently released. Therein, physical activity was reported as a novel PAM metric known as Monitor Independent Movement Summary (MIMS) units. Currently, limited information exists regarding the relationship between daily MIMS and cardiometabolic risk factors. Purpose: To determine the association between MIMS/day and Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) risk factors using a nationally representative dataset for US adults aged 18-65 years. Methods: NHANES PAM data were collected using a tri-axial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+; 80Hz, 24/7 wear-time protocol on non-dominant wrist). Valid wear-time was considered ‚â•10h/day and ‚â•4 valid days. MetS risk factors included: waist circumference, triglycerides, HDL-C, blood pressure, fasting glucose. Simple linear regression (accounting for survey sample weights) was performed to determine the relationship between increasing number of risk factors and MIMS/day. Results: The analytical sample comprised n=4578 individuals with valid wear-time (mean¬±SD; 22.1¬±1.9 h/day, 6.7¬±0.7 days). MIMS/day was negatively associated (p\&lt;0.001) with increasing number of risk factors. Physical activity level decreased -557 MIMS/day (Œ≤-coefficient) for every one-unit increase in the number of risk factors. Mean [95\%CI] for risk factor levels were: no risk factors (13792 [13643‚Äì14358]); 3 risk factors (11863 [11709‚Äì12312]), all 5 risk factors 10425 [10159,11771] MIMS/day. Conclusions: Higher MIMS/day values were associated with absence of risk factors, with a progressive decline as number of MetS risk factors increased. These MIMS/day values may be considered preliminary benchmark values associated with cardiometabolic risk for the US adult population.},

	abstract = {Objective
              While general population studies have shown inverse associations between physical activity and common inflammatory biomarkers, the effects of physical activity on inflammatory gene expression and signaling pathways in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remain unknown. We aimed to determine whether physical activity independently associates with expression of inflammatory genes among people with RA.
            
            
              Methods
              This was a prospective observational study of adults with RA. Physical activity was measured by quantitative actigraphy over 7 consecutive days, and peripheral blood collected during the same time period was used for RNA sequencing followed by differential gene expression, pathway, and network analyses.
            
            
              Results
              Actigraphy and RNA sequencing data was evaluated on 35 patients. The cohort mean age was 56¬±12 years, 91\% female, 31\% white, 9\% African American, 9\% Asian, 40\% Hispanic. We found 767 genes differentially expressed (padj{\textless}0.1) between patients in the greatest versus lowest physical activity tertiles, after adjusting for sex, age, race, and ethnicity. The most active patients exhibited dose-dependent downregulation of several immune signaling pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis. These included CD40, STAT3, TREM-1, IL-17a, IL-8, toll-like receptor and interferon signaling pathways. Upstream cytokine activation state analysis predicted reduced activation of TNF-alpha and interferon in the most active group. In sensitivity analyses we adjusted for RA disease activity and physical function and found consistent results.
            
            
              Conclusion
              RA patients who were more physically active had lower expression of immune signaling pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis, even after adjusting for disease activity, suggesting that physical activity may confer a protective effect in RA.},

	abstract = {Background
              Emerging evidence suggests accruing sedentary behavior (SB) in relatively more prolonged periods may convey additional cardiometabolic risks, but few studies have examined prospective outcomes. We examined the association of SB accumulation patterns with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and all‚Äêcause mortality (ACM).
            
            
              Methods and Results
              
                Data were from 7671 EPIC‚ÄêNorfolk (European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition‚ÄìNorfolk) cohort middle‚Äê to older‚Äêaged adults who wore accelerometers on the right hip for 4 to 7¬†days. Cox proportional hazards regression modeled associations between 2 measures of SB accumulation and incident CVD, cancer, and ACM. These were usual SB bout duration (the midpoint of each individual‚Äôs SB accumulation curve, fitted using nonlinear regression) and alpha (hybrid measure of bout frequency and duration, with higher values indicating relatively shorter bouts and fewer long bouts). Models were adjusted for potential confounders, then further for 24‚Äêhour time‚Äêuse compositions. During mean follow‚Äêup time of 6.4¬†years, 339 ACM, 1106 CVD, and 516 cancer events occurred. Elevated rates of incident cancer and ACM were seen with more prolonged SB accumulation (lower alpha, higher usual SB bout duration) but not CVD. For usual SB bout duration and alpha, respectively, the confounder‚Äêadjusted hazard ratios per SD of the exposure were 1.12 (95\% CI, 1.02‚Äì1.23) and 0.88 (95\% CI, 0.79‚Äì0.98) with incident cancer and 1.16 (95\% CI, 1.07‚Äì1.26) and 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.72‚Äì0.89) with ACM (all
                P
                {\textless}0.05). Further adjustment for 24‚Äêhour time use weakened associations with ACM for usual bout duration (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95\% CI, 0.97‚Äì1.16;
                P
                =0.209) and partially for alpha (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.77‚Äì0.99;
                P
                =0.029).
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Accruing SB in longer bout durations was associated with higher rates of incident cancer and ACM but not with incident CVD, with some evidence of direct SB accumulation effects independent of 24‚Äêhour time use. Findings provide some support for considering SB accumulation as an adjunct target of messaging to ‚Äúsit less and move more.‚Äù},

            Background
            Given the evolution of processing and analyzing accelerometry data over the past decade, it is of utmost importance that we as a field understand how newer (e.g., MIMS) summary measures compare to long-established ones (e.g., ActiGraph activity counts).
          
          
            Objective
            Our study aims to compare and harmonize accelerometry-based measures of physical activity (PA) to increase the comparability, generalizability, and translation of findings across studies using objective measures of PA.
          
          
            Methods
            High resolution accelerometry data were collected from 655 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging who wore an ActiGraph GT9X device at wrist continuously for a week. Data were summarized at the minute-level as activity counts (AC; measure obtained from ActiGraph‚Äôs ActiLife software) and MIMS, ENMO, MAD, and AI (open-source measures implemented in R). The correlation between AC and other measures was quantified both marginally and conditionally on age, sex and BMI. Next, each pair of measures were harmonized using nonparametric regression of minute-level measurements.
          
          
            Results
            
              The study sample had the following characteristics: mean (sd) age of 69.8 (14.2), BMI of 27.3 (5.0) kg/m
              2
              , 54.5\% females, and 67.9\% white. The marginal participant-specific correlation between AC and MIMS, ENMO, MAD, and AI were 0.988, 0.867, 0.913 and 0.970, respectively. After harmonization, the mean absolute percentage error for predicting total AC from MIMS, ENMO, MAD, and AI was 2.5, 14.3, 11.3 and 6.3, respectively. The accuracy for predicting sedentary minutes based on AC (AC {\textgreater} 1853) using MIMS, ENMO, MAD and AI was 0.981, 0.928, 0.904, and 0.960, respectively. An R software with a unified interface for computation of the open-source measures from raw accelerometry data was developed and published as SummarizedActigraphy R package.
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            Our comparison of accelerometry-based measures of PA enables researchers to extend the knowledge from the thousands of manuscripts that have been published using ActiGraph AC to MIMS and other measures by demonstrating their high correlation and providing a harmonization mapping.},

Cognitive function was assessed using the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) and animal fluency test (AFT). Habitual PA was collected using a triaxial accelerometer worn on participants‚Äô nondominant wrist. PA was expressed as 2 metrics using monitor-independent movement summary (MIMS) units: the average of Daily MIMS (MIMS/day) and peak 30-minute MIMS (Peak-30MIMS; the average of the highest 30 MIMS min/d). Sample weight-adjusted multivariable linear regression was performed to determine the relationship between each cognitive score and MIMS metric while adjusting for covariates.

              After controlling for covariates, for each 1 000-unit increase in Daily MIMS, DSST score increased (Œ≤-coefficient [95\% CIs]) by 0.67 (0.40, 0.93), whereas AFT score increased by 0.13 (0.04, 0.22); for each 1-unit increase in Peak-30MIMS, DSST score increased by 0.56 (0.42, 0.70), whereas AFT score increased by 0.10 (0.05, 0.15), all p \&lt; .001. When including both MIMS metrics in a single model, the association between Peak-30MIMS and cognitive scores remained significant (p \&lt; .01), whereas Daily MIMS did not.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings suggest that higher PA (both daily accumulated and peak effort) is associated with better cognitive function in the U.S. older adult population.},

	abstract = {Purpose.
              Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may cause not only inflammation in the lungs but also systemic effects. One potential strategy to reduce systemic inflammation and attenuate disease progression is physical activity (PA). However, no nationally representative studies, to our knowledge, have examined the association between objectively measured physical activity and inflammation among those with COPD.
            
            
              Design.
              Cross-sectional.
            
            
              Setting.
              National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003‚Äì2006.
            
            
              Subjects.
              Two hundred thirty-eight former or current smokers with self-reported COPD who had complete data on study variables.
            
            
              Measures.
              Participants wore an accelerometer for ‚â•4 days to assess light-intensity PA (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), and total physical activity (TPA); completed questionnaires to assess self-reported COPD and smoking status; and had their blood taken to assess white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil levels.
            
            
              Analysis.
              Multivariable linear regression analysis was used.
            
            
              Results.
              LPA (Œ≤ = ‚Äì.0004), MVPA (Œ≤ = ‚Äì.04), and TPA (Œ≤ = ‚Äì.0004) were significantly inversely associated with WBC level. Similarly, LPA (Œ≤ = ‚Äì.001) and TPA (Œ≤ = ‚Äì.001) were significantly inversely associated with neutrophils; however, MVPA was marginally associated with neutrophils (Œ≤ = ‚Äì.05; p =.06).
            
            
              Conclusion.
              These analyses demonstrate an inverse association between objectively measured PA and inflammation among current or former smokers with COPD. If these findings are confirmed elsewhere, then PA among those with COPD may serve as an anti-inflammatory strategy to possibly decrease cardiovascular and metabolic disease occurrence.},

              Background
              The 24-h rest and activity behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary behaviors and sleep) are fundamental human behaviors essential to health and well-being. Functional principal component analysis (fPCA) is a flexible approach for characterizing rest-activity rhythms and does not rely on a priori assumptions about the activity shape. The objective of our study is to apply fPCA to a nationally representative sample of American adults to characterize variations in the 24-h rest-activity pattern, determine how the pattern differs according to demographic, socioeconomic and work characteristics, and examine its associations with general health status.
            
            
              Methods
              The current analysis used data from adults 25 or older in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2011‚Äì2014). Using 7-day 24-h actigraphy recordings, we applied fPCA to derive profiles for overall, weekday and weekend rest-activity patterns. We examined the association between each rest-activity profile in relation to age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income and working status using multiple linear regression. We also used multiple logistic regression to determine the relationship between each rest-activity profile and the likelihood of reporting poor or fair health.
            
            
              Results
              We identified four distinct profiles (i.e., high amplitude, early rise, prolonged activity window, biphasic pattern) that together accounted for 86.8\% of total variation in the study sample. We identified numerous associations between each rest-activity profile and multiple sociodemographic characteristics. We also found evidence suggesting the associations differed between weekdays and weekends. Finally, we reported that the rest-activity profiles were associated with self-rated health.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our study provided evidence suggesting that rest-activity patterns in human populations are shaped by multiple demographic, socioeconomic and work factors, and are correlated with health status.},

            We aimed to provide objectively measured sleep parameters across lifespan by sex and race in a national representative sample of US population. The study included 11,279 participants 6¬†years and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011‚Äì2014, who had at least 3¬†days of valid sleep parameters calculated from 7-day 24-h accelerometer recording. Sleep duration showed a U-shaped association with age and reached the minimum at age 40 and started to increase again around age 50. The clock time for sleep onset (CTSO) delayed with age and reached the maximum at about age 20. CTSO then advanced until age 50, leveled off until age 70, then advanced again after age 70. Sleep efficiency showed an overall decreasing trend across the lifespan but stabilized from age 30 to about age 60. US young adults in age 20¬†s are the ones who slept at the latest around midnight, while the middle aged US residents between 40 and 50¬†years old slept the least. Females generally present longer sleep duration than males, while more likely to have later sleep onset, particularly at older ages. Non-Hispanic Blacks showed worse sleep characteristics, i.e. sleep later, sleep shorter, and sleep less efficiently, compared to other racial groups. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights on the characteristics of sleep habits of residents of the United States by using objectively measurements of sleep parameters and will help guide personalized advice on sleep hygiene.},

              Digital health programs assist patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to better manage their disease. Technological and adoption barriers have been perceived as a limitation.
            
            
              Objective
              The aim of the research was to evaluate a digital quality improvement pilot in Medicare-eligible patients with COPD.
            
            
              Methods
              COPD patients were enrolled in a digital platform to help manage their medications and symptoms as part of their routine clinical care. Patients were provided with electronic medication monitors (EMMs) to monitor short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) use passively and a smartphone app to track use trends and receive feedback. Providers also had access to data collected via a secure website and were sent email notifications if a patient had a significant change in their prescribed inhaler use. Providers then determined if follow-up was needed. Change in SABA use and feasibility outcomes were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 190 patients enrolled in the pilot. At 3, 6, and 12 months, patients recorded significant reductions in daily and nighttime SABA use and increases in SABA-free days (all P{\textless}.001). Patient engagement, as measured by the ratio of daily active use to monthly active use, was {\textgreater}90\% at both 6 and 12 months. Retention at 6 months was 81\% (154/190). Providers were sent on average two email notifications per patient during the 12-month program.
            
            
              Conclusions
              A digital health program integrated as part of standard clinical practice was feasible and had low provider burden. The pilot demonstrated significant reduction in SABA use and increased SABA-free days among Medicare-eligible COPD patients. Further, patients readily adopted the digital platform and demonstrated strong engagement and retention rates at 6 and 12 months.},

              Background
              Proper inhaler device usage is paramount for control of underlying obstructive airway disease. Hence, education to healthcare professionals who will eventually educate patients need to be done effectively. We developed an application for mobile devices for education on six medical inhaler devices, the metered-dose inhaler (MDI), Turbuhaler, Accuhaler, Breezhaler, Ellipta and Respimat, and studied if there were any difference between the application and the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions on inhaler technique. The aim of this study is to see if inhaler education via a mobile phone app is comparable to manual instruction for health care professions.
            
            
              Methods
              Participants, who were nursing students, were randomized to learn the inhaler devices via the manufacturer‚Äôs instruction guide or a mobile device app designed specifically for education on inhaler devices.
            
            
              Results
              
                There were 45 participants in each group. 78\% of them were females with a median age of 21 (IQR 3). 67\% used an Apple mobile device and the remainder used an Android device. The mobile device showed better total improvement points for the Turbuhaler device (262 vs 287 points;
                P
                ‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.02). Participants learning from the manufacturer‚Äôs guide had a significantly higher total improvement points in the Breezhaler (370 vs 327 points;
                P
                ‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.01) and Ellipta (214 vs 174 points; P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.01) device. Both interventions showed improvement in total scores for demonstrating the correct usage of all inhaler devices. MDI has the least number of correct steps for both interventions. The participants‚Äô reported their mean (SD) self-rated knowledge was significantly higher for those using the app for all devices as compared to those that did not (4.33 (0.68) vs 4.73 (0.42); P‚Äâ=‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.01). Self-reported confidence level was found to be higher in the mobile app group, but this was not statistically significant.

	abstract = {There is a need for instruments designed for patients with asthma to self-report their performance of inhaling steps. We aimed to develop an accessible and easy-to-use patient-reported tool for inhaler technique assessment, which could also serve as a training and monitoring resource for any type of inhaler device, and to evaluate its feasibility, validity, and reliability in adults with asthma. The development was based on literature review and pilot testing with clinicians and patients. The Inhaler Technique Questionnaire (InTeQ) asks about the frequency of performing five steps when using inhalers (on a five-point Likert scale). We analyzed data from adults with persistent asthma (n = 361). We examined the measurement model using Mokken scaling analysis, construct validity by assessing hypotheses on expected discrimination among known groups, and reliability based on internal consistency and reproducibility. Means of the InTeQ items were in the range of 0.23‚Äì1.61, and coefficients of homogeneity were above the cutoff point, demonstrating the unidimensionality of the scale. Known groups‚Äô global score differences were statistically significant between patients reporting having ‚ÄúDiscussed in detail‚Äù or having ‚ÄúNot discussed/Only in general‚Äù the inhaler technique with their healthcare providers (p = 0.023). The Cronbach‚Äôs alpha coefficient was 0.716, and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.775. The InTeQ is a feasible, valid, and reliable instrument for self-reporting inhaler technique on any type of device.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Objectively measured differences in physical activity (PA) and sleep have been documented among people with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared to non-arthritic controls. However, it is not clear whether OA and RA subgroups also differ on these indexes or the extent to which distinct arthritis subgroups versus controls can be accurately identified on the basis of objective PA and sleep indexes compared to self-report responses on questionnaires. This study addressed these gaps.
            
            
              Methods
              
                This case-control study comprised Chinese adults with OA (
                N
                ‚Äâ=‚Äâ40) or RA (
                N
                ‚Äâ=‚Äâ40) diagnoses based on physician assessments as well as a control group of adults without chronic pain (
                N
                ‚Äâ=‚Äâ40). All participants wore a Sensewear Armband (SWA) for consecutive 7 days and completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form-Chinese as well as Pittsburgh Sleep Diary to obtain objective and subjective PA and sleep data, respectively.
              
            
            
              Results
              There were no differences between the three groups on any self-report indexes of PA or sleep. Conversely, OA and RA subgroups displayed significantly lower PA levels and more sleep problems than controls did on a majority of SWA indexes, though arthritis subgroups were not differentiated from one another on these measures. Logistic regression analyses indicated four non-multicollinear SWA indexes (i.e., steps, active energy expenditure, vigorous activity, time awake after sleep onset) correctly identified the subgroup membership of 75.0‚Äì82.5\% of participants with RA or OA while classification accuracy results were attenuated for controls.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Where possible, objective measures should be used to assess PA and sleep of adults with OA and RA while particular self-report PA questionnaires should be used sparingly.},

	abstract = {Objectives
              Research demonstrates that sedentary behaviour may contribute towards cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study explored diurnal patterns of sedentary time and physical activity (PA) in RA and examined associations with long-term CVD risk.
            
            
              Methods
              97 RA patients wore an accelerometer for 7 days to assess sedentary time, light-intensity and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA. Estimated 10-year CVD risk was determined via QRISK score. Hourly estimates of sedentary time and PA (min/hour) were computed for valid-wear hours (ie, valid-wear¬†=¬†60¬†min/hour of activity data, ‚â•3¬†days). Hourly data were averaged across time periods to represent morning (08:00‚Äì11:59), afternoon (12:00‚Äì17:59) and evening (18:00‚Äì22:59) behaviour. Participants providing data for ‚â•2 complete time periods/day (eg, morning/evening, or morning/afternoon) were used in the main analysis (n¬†=¬†41). Mixed linear modelling explored the associations between 10-year CVD risk and within-person (time: morning, afternoon, evening) changes in sedentary time and PA.
            
            
              Results
              Sedentary time was higher, and light-intensity and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA lower in the evening, compared to morning and afternoon. Significant interactions revealed individuals with higher CVD risk were more sedentary and did less light-intensity PA during the afternoon and evening. Findings remained significant after adjustment for disease duration, functional ability and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Results suggest that the evening time period may offer a significant window of opportunity for interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour in RA and contribute to associated improvements in CVD risk. Due to inverse patterns of engagement, replacing sedentary time with light-intensity PA may offer an effective approach for intervention.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Sleep disturbances increase with age and are predictors of mortality. Here, we present deep neural networks that estimate age and mortality risk through polysomnograms (PSGs). Aging was modeled using 2500 PSGs and tested in 10,699 PSGs from men and women in seven different cohorts aged between 20 and 90. Ages were estimated with a mean absolute error of 5.8‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.6‚Äâyears, while basic sleep scoring measures had an error of 14.9‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ6.29‚Äâyears. After controlling for demographics, sleep, and health covariates, each 10-year increment in age estimate error (AEE) was associated with increased all-cause mortality rate of 29\% (95\% confidence interval: 20‚Äì39\%). An increase from ‚àí10 to +10‚Äâyears in AEE translates to an estimated decreased life expectancy of 8.7‚Äâyears (95\% confidence interval: 6.1‚Äì11.4‚Äâyears). Greater AEE was mostly reflected in increased sleep fragmentation, suggesting this is an important biomarker of future health independent of sleep apnea.},

Euthymic individuals with BD (n = 69) undertook 3 weeks of actigraphy recording and were then followed up for a median duration of 3.5 years. Principal component analyses were used to identify core dimensions of sleep quantity/variability and circadian rhythmicity. Associations between clinical variables and actigraphy dimensions and time to first recurrence were explored using survival analyses, and then using area under the curve (AUC) analyses (early vs. late recurrence). Most participants (64\%) experienced a recurrence during follow-up (median survival time: 18 months). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, an actigraphy dimension comprising amplitude and variability/stability of circadian rhythms was a significant predictor of time to recurrence (p = 0.009). The AUC for correct classification of early vs. late recurrence subgroups was only 0.64 for clinical predictors, but combining these variables with objectively measured intra-day variability improved the AUC to 0.82 (p = 0.04).

              Circadian rhythm disturbance occurs in type 2 diabetes, yet it is unknown whether it also exists in the prediagnostic phase of the disease. Thus, we examined the association of rest-activity circadian rhythm with 2-hour glucose levels and the risk of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in a nationally representative sample of adults without diabetes using a cross-sectional design.
            
            
              Research design and methods
              We analyzed data from 2760 adults without diabetes (age ‚â•20) with at least 4‚Äâdays of validated accelerometer recordings and a valid oral glucose tolerance test from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011‚Äì2014. Non-parametric rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters were derived from the accelerometer recordings.
            
            
              Results
              In the models adjusting for multiple covariates, a one-quantile increase in relative amplitude (ie, increased circadian rhythmicity) was associated with 2.66‚Äâmg/dL decrease in 2-hour glucose level (95\%‚ÄâCI ‚àí3.94 to ‚àí1.38, p{\textless}0.001) and a decreased odds of IGT (OR 0.75, 95\%‚ÄâCI 0.63 to 0.89, p=0.002). A one-quantile increase in intradaily variability (ie, increased rhythm fragmentation) was associated with 3.01‚Äâmg/dL increase in 2-hour glucose level (95\%‚ÄâCI 1.52 to 4.49, p=0.001) and an increased odds of IGT (OR 1.37, 95\%‚ÄâCI 1.19 to 1.58, p{\textless}0.001).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Circadian disruption is significantly associated with impaired glucose homeostasis in a general population of adults without diabetes. The association of circadian rhythm abnormalities with indicators of the pre-diabetic state suggests that circadian dysfunction may contribute to early disease pathogenesis.},

            Objective measures, such as activity monitoring, can potentially complement clinical assessment for psychiatric patients. Alterations in rest‚Äìactivity patterns are commonly encountered in patients with major depressive disorder. The aim of this study was to investigate whether features of activity patterns correlate with severity of depression symptoms (evaluated by Montgomery‚Äì√Ösberg Rating Scale (MADRS) for depression). We used actigraphy recordings collected during ongoing major depressive episodes from patients not undergoing any antidepressant treatment. The recordings were acquired from two independent studies using different actigraphy systems. Data was quality-controlled and pre-processed for feature extraction following uniform procedures. We trained multiple regression models to predict MADRS score from features of activity patterns using brute-force and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms. The models were filtered based on the precision and the accuracy of fitting on training dataset before undergoing external validation on an independent dataset. The features enriched in the models surviving external validation point to high depressive symptom severity being associated with less complex activity patterns and stronger coupling to external circadian entrainers. Our results bring proof-of-concept evidence that activity patterns correlate with severity of depressive symptoms and suggest that actigraphy recordings may be a useful tool for individual evaluation of patients with major depressive disorder.},

	abstract = {Background
              The prevalence of obesity continues to increase in spite of substantial efforts towards its prevention, posing a major threat to health globally. Circadian disruption has been associated with a wide range of preclinical and clinical disorders, including obesity. However, whether rest-activity rhythm (RAR), an expression of the endogenous circadian rhythm, is associated with excess adiposity is poorly understood. Here we aimed to assess the association of RAR with general and abdominal obesity.
            
            
              Methods
              Non-institutionalized adults aged ‚â•20 years participating in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014 who wore accelerometers for at least four 24-hour periods were included (N=7,838). Amplitude, mesor, acrophase and pseudo-F statistic of RAR were estimated using extended cosinor model, and interdaily stability (IS) and intradaily variability (IV) were computed by nonparametric methods. We tested the association between rest-activity rhythm and general obesity defined by body mass index and abdominal obesity by waist circumference. Waist-to-height ratio, sagittal abdominal diameter, and total and trunk fat percentages measured by imaging methods were also analyzed.
            
            
              Results
              
                In multivariable analysis, low amplitude (magnitude of the rhythm), mesor (rhythm-corrected average activity level), pseudo-F statistic (robustness of the rhythm), IS (day-to-day rhythm stability), or high IV (rhythm fragmentation) were independently associated with higher likelihood of general or abdominal obesity (all
                Ps
                \&lt;.05). Consistently, RAR metrics were similarly associated with all adiposity measures (all
                Ps
                \&lt;.01). Delayed phase of RAR (later acrophase) was only significantly related to general and abdominal obesity in women.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Aberrant RAR is independently associated with anthropometric and imaging measures of general and abdominal obesity. Longitudinal studies assessing whether RAR metrics can predict weight gain and incident obesity are warranted.},

              While 24-h total sleep time (TST) is established as a critical driver of major depression, the relationships between sleep timing and regularity and mental health remain poorly characterized because most studies have relied on either self-report assessments or traditional objective sleep measurements restricted to cross-sectional time frames and small cohorts. To address this gap, we assessed sleep with a wearable device, daily mood with a smartphone application and depression through the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) over the demanding first year of physician training (internship). In 2115 interns, reduced TST (

            The influence of the circadian clock on sleep scheduling has been studied extensively in the laboratory; however, the effects of society on sleep remain largely unquantified. We show how a smartphone app that we have developed, ENTRAIN, accurately collects data on sleep habits around the world. Through mathematical modeling and statistics, we find that social pressures weaken and/or conceal biological drives in the evening, leading individuals to delay their bedtime and shorten their sleep. A country‚Äôs average bedtime, but not average wake time, predicts sleep duration. We further show that mathematical models based on controlled laboratory experiments predict qualitative trends in sunrise, sunset, and light level; however, these effects are attenuated in the real world around bedtime. Additionally, we find that women schedule more sleep than men and that users reporting that they are typically exposed to outdoor light go to sleep earlier and sleep more than those reporting indoor light. Finally, we find that age is the primary determinant of sleep timing, and that age plays an important role in the variability of population-level sleep habits. This work better defines and personalizes ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sleep, produces hypotheses for future testing in the laboratory, and suggests important ways to counteract the global sleep crisis.},

              The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted lives and greatly affected the mental health and public safety of an already vulnerable population‚Äîcollege students. Social distancing and isolation measures have presented challenges to students‚Äô mental health. mHealth apps and wearable sensors may help monitor students at risk of COVID-19 and support their mental well-being.
            
            
              Objective
              This study aimed to monitor students at risk of COVID-19 by using a wearable sensor and a smartphone-based survey.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted a prospective study on undergraduate and graduate students at a public university in the Midwest United States. Students were instructed to download the Fitbit, Social Rhythms, and Roadmap 2.0 apps onto their personal smartphone devices (Android or iOS). Subjects consented to provide up to 10 saliva samples during the study period. Surveys were administered through the Roadmap 2.0 app at five timepoints: at baseline, 1 month later, 2 months later, 3 months later, and at study completion. The surveys gathered information regarding demographics, COVID-19 diagnoses and symptoms, and mental health resilience, with the aim of documenting the impact of COVID-19 on the college student population.
            
            
              Results
              This study enrolled 2158 college students between September 2020 and January 2021. Subjects are currently being followed-up for 1 academic year. Data collection and analysis are currently underway.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study examined student health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed the feasibility of using a wearable sensor and a survey in a college student population, which may inform the role of our mHealth tools in assessing student health and well-being. Finally, using data derived from a wearable sensor, biospecimen collection, and self-reported COVID-19 diagnosis, our results may provide key data toward the development of a model for the early prediction and detection of COVID-19.

	abstract = {Background
              Health care workers (HCWs) have been working on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic with high risks of viral exposure, infection, and transmission. Standard COVID-19 testing is insufficient to protect HCWs from these risks and prevent the spread of disease. Continuous monitoring of physiological data with wearable sensors, self-monitoring of symptoms, and asymptomatic COVID-19 testing may aid in the early detection of COVID-19 in HCWs and may help reduce further transmission among HCWs, patients, and families.
            
            
              Objective
              By using wearable sensors, smartphone-based symptom logging, and biospecimens, this project aims to assist HCWs in self-monitoring COVID-19.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study of HCWs at a single institution. The study duration was 1 year, wherein participants were instructed on the continuous use of two wearable sensors (Fitbit Charge 3 smartwatch and TempTraq temperature patches) for up to 30 days. Participants consented to provide biospecimens (ie, nasal swabs, saliva swabs, and blood) for up to 1 year from study entry. Using a smartphone app called Roadmap 2.0, participants entered a daily mood score, submitted daily COVID-19 symptoms, and completed demographic and health-related quality of life surveys at study entry and 30 days later. Semistructured qualitative interviews were also conducted at the end of the 30-day period, following completion of daily mood and symptoms reporting as well as continuous wearable sensor use.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 226 HCWs were enrolled between April 28 and December 7, 2020. The last participant completed the 30-day study procedures on January 16, 2021. Data collection will continue through January 2023, and data analyses are ongoing.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Using wearable sensors, smartphone-based symptom logging and survey completion, and biospecimen collections, this study will potentially provide data on the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among HCWs at a single institution. The study will also assess the feasibility of leveraging wearable sensors and self-monitoring of symptoms in an HCW population.

	abstract = {Shift workers, who are exposed to irregular sleep schedules resulting in sleep deprivation and misalignment of circadian rhythms, have an increased risk of diabetes relative to day workers. In healthy adults, sleep restriction without circadian misalignment promotes insulin resistance. To determine whether the misalignment of circadian rhythms that typically occurs in shift work involves intrinsic adverse metabolic effects independently of sleep loss, a parallel group design was used to study 26 healthy adults. Both interventions involved 3 inpatient days with 10-h bedtimes, followed by 8 inpatient days of sleep restriction to 5 h with fixed nocturnal bedtimes (circadian alignment) or with bedtimes delayed by 8.5 h on 4 of the 8 days (circadian misalignment). Daily total sleep time (SD) during the intervention was nearly identical in the aligned and misaligned conditions (4 h 48 min [5 min] vs. 4 h 45 min [6 min]). In both groups, insulin sensitivity (SI) significantly decreased after sleep restriction, without a compensatory increase in insulin secretion, and inflammation increased. In male participants exposed to circadian misalignment, the reduction in SI and the increase in inflammation both doubled compared with those who maintained regular nocturnal bedtimes. Circadian misalignment that occurs in shift work may increase diabetes risk and inflammation, independently of sleep loss.},

	abstract = {Shift work is a risk factor for inflammation, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. This increased risk cannot be fully explained by classical risk factors. Shift workers‚Äô behavioral and environmental cycles are typically misaligned relative to their endogenous circadian system. However, there is little information on the impact of acute circadian misalignment on cardiovascular disease risk in shift workers, independent of differences in work stress, food quality, and other factors that are likely to differ between night and day shifts. Thus, our objectives were to determine the independent effect of circadian misalignment on 24-h high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP; a marker of systemic inflammation) and blood pressure levels‚Äîcardiovascular disease risk factors‚Äîin chronic shift workers. Chronic shift workers undertook two 3-day laboratory protocols that simulated night work, comprising 12-hour inverted behavioral and environmental cycles (circadian misalignment) or simulated day work (circadian alignment), using a randomized, crossover design. Circadian misalignment increased 24-h hs-CRP by 11\% ( p {\textless} 0.0001). Circadian misalignment increased 24-h systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 1.4 mmHg and 0.8 mmHg, respectively (both p ‚â§ 0.038). The misalignment-mediated increase in 24-h SBP was primarily explained by an increase in SBP during the wake period (+1.7 mmHg; p = 0.017), whereas the misalignment-mediated increase in 24-h DBP was primarily explained by an increase in DBP during the sleep opportunity (+1.8 mmHg; p = 0.005). Circadian misalignment per se increases hs-CRP and blood pressure in shift workers. This may help explain the increased inflammation, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease risk in shift workers.},

	abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has affected nearly 28 million people in the United States and has caused more than five hundred thousand deaths as of February 21, 2021. As the novel coronavirus continues to take its toll in the United States and all across the globe, particularly among the elderly (\&gt;65 years), clinicians and translational researchers are taking a closer look at the nexus of sleep, circadian rhythms and immunity that may contribute toward a more severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2-induced multi-organ failure affects both central and peripheral organs, causing increased mortality in the elderly. However, whether differences in sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity between older and younger individuals contribute to the age-related differences in systemic dysregulation of target organs observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unknown. Current literature demonstrates the emerging role of sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity in the development of chronic pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections in human and mouse models. The exact mechanism underlying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other cardiopulmonary complications in elderly patients in combination with associated comorbidities remain unclear. Nevertheless, understanding the critical role of sleep, circadian clock dysfunction in target organs, and immune status of patients with SARS-CoV-2 may provide novel insights into possible therapies. Chronotherapy is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in sleep medicine. Accumulating evidence suggests that nearly half of all physiological functions follow a strict daily rhythm. However, healthcare professionals rarely take implementing timed-administration of drugs into consideration. In this review, we summarize recent findings directly relating to the contributing roles of sleep, circadian rhythms and immune response in modulating infectious disease processes, and integrate chronotherapy in the discussion of the potential drugs that can be repurposed to improve the treatment and management of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are approximately 24 h cycles in physiology and behaviour that enable organisms to anticipate predictable rhythmic changes in their environment. These rhythms are a hallmark of normal healthy physiology, and disruption of circadian rhythms has implications for cognitive, metabolic, cardiovascular and immune function. Circadian disruption is of increasing concern, and may occur as a result of the pressures of our modern 24/7 society‚Äîincluding artificial light exposure, shift-work and jet-lag. In addition, circadian disruption is a common comorbidity in many different conditions, ranging from aging to neurological disorders. A key feature of circadian disruption is the breakdown of robust, reproducible rhythms with increasing fragmentation between activity and rest. Circadian researchers have developed a range of methods for estimating the period of time series, typically based upon periodogram analysis. However, the methods used to quantify circadian disruption across the literature are not consistent. Here we describe a range of different measures that have been used to measure circadian disruption, with a particular focus on laboratory rodent data. These methods include periodogram power, variability in activity onset, light phase activity, activity bouts, interdaily stability, intradaily variability and relative amplitude. The strengths and limitations of these methods are described, as well as their normal ranges and interrelationships. Whilst there is an increasing appreciation of circadian disruption as both a risk to health and a potential therapeutic target, greater consistency in the quantification of disrupted rhythms is needed.},

              Study Objectives
              Disturbances of rest‚Äìactivity rhythms are associated with higher body mass index (BMI) in adults. Whether such relationship exists in children is unclear. We aimed to examine cross-sectional associations of rest‚Äìactivity rhythm characteristics with BMI z-score and obesity-related inflammatory markers in school-age children.
            
            
              Methods
              Participants included 411 healthy children (mean ¬± SD age 10.1 ¬± 1.3 years, 50.8\% girls) from a Mediterranean area of Spain who wore wrist accelerometers for 7 consecutive days. Metrics of rest‚Äìactivity rhythm were derived using both parametric and nonparametric approaches. Obesity-related inflammatory markers were measured in saliva (n = 121).
            
            
              Results
              In a multivariable-adjusted model, higher BMI z-score is associated with less robust 24-h rest‚Äìactivity rhythms as represented by lower relative amplitude (‚Äì0.16 [95\% CI ‚Äì0.29, ‚Äì0.02] per SD, p = 0.02). The association between BMI z-score and relative amplitude persisted with additional adjustment for sleep duration, and attenuated after adjustment for daytime activity level. Less robust rest‚Äìactivity rhythms were related to increased levels of several salivary pro-inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, which is inversely associated with relative amplitude (‚Äì32.6\% [‚Äì47.8\%, ‚Äì12.9\%] per SD), independently of BMI z-score, sleep duration, and daytime activity level.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Blunted rest‚Äìactivity rhythms are associated with higher BMI z-score and salivary pro-inflammatory markers already at an early age. The association with BMI z-score seem to be independent of sleep duration, and those with pro-inflammatory markers further independent of BMI z-score and daytime activity. Novel intervention targets at an early age based on improving the strength of rest‚Äìactivity rhythms may help to prevent childhood obesity and related inflammation.

            Chronic increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines in older adults, known as inflammaging, are an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality in the aging population. It has been suggested that circadian disruption may play a role in chronic inflammation, but there has been limited study that investigated the overall profile of 24-hour rest‚Äìactivity rhythms in relation to inflammation using longitudinal data. In the Outcomes of Sleep Disorders in Older Men Study, we applied the extended cosine model to derive multiple rest‚Äìactivity rhythm characteristics using multiday actigraphy, and examined their associations with 6 inflammatory markers (ie, C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-Œ±], tumor necrosis factor alpha soluble receptor II [TNF-Œ±-sRII], interleukin-1Œ≤ [IL-1Œ≤], interferon gamma [IFN-Œ≥]) measured from fasting blood. We assessed both the cross-sectional association between rest‚Äìactivity rhythms and inflammatory markers measured at baseline, and the prospective association between baseline rest‚Äìactivity rhythms and changes in inflammatory markers over 3.5 years of follow-up. We found that multiple rest‚Äìactivity characteristics, including lower amplitude and relative amplitude, and decreased overall rhythmicity, were associated with higher levels of CRP, IL-6, TNF-Œ±, and TNF-Œ±-sRII, but not IL-1Œ≤ and IFN-Œ≥ at baseline. Moreover, the lowest quartile of these 3 rest‚Äìactivity characteristics was associated with an approximately 2-fold increase in the odds of having elevated inflammation (ie, having 3 or more markers in the highest quartile) at baseline. However, we found little evidence supporting a relationship between rest‚Äìactivity rhythm characteristics and changes in inflammatory markers. Future studies should clarify the dynamic relationship between rest‚Äìactivity rhythms and inflammation in different populations, and evaluate the effects of improving rest‚Äìactivity profiles on inflammation and related disease outcomes.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The association between low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and all-cause mortality has been examined in many studies. However, inconsistent results and limitations still exist. We used the 1999‚Äì2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data with 19,034 people to assess the association between LDL-C level and all-cause mortality. All participants were followed up until 2015 except those younger than 18¬†years old, after excluding those who died within three years of follow-up, a total of 1619 deaths among 19,034 people were included in the analysis. In the age-adjusted model (model 1), it was found that the lowest LDL-C group had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.708 [1.432‚Äì2.037]) than LDL-C 100‚Äì129¬†mg/dL as a reference group. The crude-adjusted model (model 2) suggests that people with the lowest level of LDL-C had 1.600 (95\% CI [1.325‚Äì1.932]) times the odds compared with the reference group, after adjusting for age, sex, race, marital status, education level, smoking status, body mass index (BMI). In the fully-adjusted model (model 3), people with the lowest level of LDL-C had 1.373 (95\% CI [1.130‚Äì1.668]) times the odds compared with the reference group, after additionally adjusting for hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer based on model 2. The results from restricted cubic spine (RCS) curve showed that when the LDL-C concentration (130¬†mg/dL) was used as the reference, there is a U-shaped relationship between LDL-C level and all-cause mortality. In conclusion, we found that low level of LDL-C is associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality. The observed association persisted after adjusting for potential confounders. Further studies are warranted to determine the causal relationship between LDL-C level and all-cause mortality.},

              Multi-systemic biological risk (MSBR), a proxy for allostatic load, is a composite index of biomarkers representing dysregulation due to responses to chronic stress. This study examined the association of an MSBR index with cancer mortality. The sample included n‚Äâ=‚Äâ13,628 adults aged 20‚Äì90 from the NHANES III Linked Mortality File (1988‚Äì1994). The MSBR index included autonomic (pulse rate, blood pressure), metabolic (HOMA
              ir
              , triglycerides, waist circumference), and immune (white blood cell count, C-reactive protein) markers. We fit Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of overall cancer mortality risk, according to quartiles (q) of the index. In multivariable models, compared to those in q1, q4 had a 64\% increased risk for cancer mortality (HR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.64, 95\% CI:1.13‚Äì2.40). The immune domain drove the association (HR per unit‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.19, 95\% CI:1.07‚Äì1.32). In stratified analyses, the HR for those with a BMI‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ25 was 1.12 per unit (95\% CI:1.05‚Äì1.19) and those with a BMI‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ25 was 1.04 per unit (95\% CI:0.92‚Äì1.18). MSBR is positively associated with risk for cancer mortality in a US sample, particularly among those who are overweight or obese. The utilization of standard clinical measures comprising this index may inform population cancer prevention strategies.},

              The optimal blood pressure of elderly people with frailty or prefrailty is still unclear. We aimed to explore the relationship between blood pressure and mortality in the elderly with (pre)frailty.
            
            
              Methods
              A total of 528 participants aged 60 years and older were exacted for analyses of the association between blood pressure and mortality from the database of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (1999‚Äì2004). Kaplan‚ÄìMeier curves and log-rank tests were used to investigate the differences in survival between groups. Multivariable Cox regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were applied to explore the relationship between blood pressure and mortality.
            
            
              Results
              
                During the median follow-up time of 116.5 [interquartile range (IQR) of 60‚Äì186] months, 363 all-cause deaths and 122 cardiac deaths were documented. For all-cause mortality, more participants died with systolic blood pressure (SBP) \&lt; 110 mmHg and SBP ‚â• 170 mmHg (log-rank

                p
                for non-linear = 0.028), with 138.6 mmHg as the lowest hazard ratio of all-cause mortality; each 10 mmHg of SBP rise was associated with a 9\% increased risk in all-cause mortality (

              Physical activity is regarded as favorable to health but effects across the spectrum of human disease are poorly quantified. In contrast to self-reported measures, wearable accelerometers can provide more precise and reproducible activity quantification. Using wrist-worn accelerometry data from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study, we test associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) ‚Äì both total MVPA minutes and whether MVPA is above a guideline-based threshold of ‚â•150‚Äâmin/week‚Äîand incidence of 697 diseases using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, Townsend Deprivation Index, educational attainment, diet quality, alcohol use, blood pressure, anti-hypertensive use. We correct for multiplicity at a false discovery rate of 1\%. We perform analogous testing using self-reported MVPA. Among 96,244 adults wearing accelerometers for one week (age 62 ¬± 8 years), MVPA is associated with 373 (54\%) tested diseases over a median 6.3 years of follow-up. Greater MVPA is overwhelmingly associated with lower disease risk (98\% of associations) with hazard ratios (HRs) ranging 0.70‚Äì0.98 per 150‚Äâmin increase in weekly MVPA, and associations spanning all 16 disease categories tested. Overall, associations with lower disease risk are enriched for cardiac (16\%), digestive (14\%), endocrine/metabolic (10\%), and respiratory conditions (8\%) (chi-square
              p
              ‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.01). Similar patterns are observed using the guideline-based threshold of ‚â•150 MVPA min/week. Some of the strongest associations with guideline-adherent activity include lower risks of incident heart failure (HR 0.65, 95\% CI 0.55‚Äì0.77), type 2 diabetes (HR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.58‚Äì0.71), cholelithiasis (HR 0.61, 95\% CI 0.54‚Äì0.70), and chronic bronchitis (HR 0.42, 95\% CI 0.33‚Äì0.54). When assessed within 456,374 individuals providing self-reported MVPA, effect sizes for guideline-adherent activity are substantially smaller (e.g., heart failure HR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.80‚Äì0.88). Greater wearable device-based physical activity is robustly associated with lower disease incidence. Future studies are warranted to identify potential mechanisms linking physical activity and disease, and assess whether optimization of measured activity can reduce disease risk.},

              Background
              Rest-activity rhythm (RAR), a manifestation of circadian rhythms, has been associated with morbidity and mortality risk. However, RAR patterns in the general population and specifically the role of demographic characteristics in RAR pattern have not been comprehensively assessed. Therefore, we aimed to describe RAR patterns among non-institutionalized US adults and age, sex, and race/ethnicity variation using accelerometry data from a nationally representative population.
            
            
              Methods
              This cross-sectional study was conducted using the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011‚Äì2014. Participants aged ‚â•20‚Äâyears who were enrolled in the physical activity monitoring examination and had at least four 24-h periods of valid wrist accelerometer data were included in the present analysis. 24-h RAR metrics were generated using both extended cosinor model (amplitude, mesor, acrophase and pseudo-F statistic) and nonparametric methods (interdaily stability [IS] and intradaily variability [IV]). Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the association between RAR and age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
            
            
              Results
              
                Eight thousand two hundred participants (mean [SE] age, 49.1 [0.5] years) were included, of whom 52.2\% were women and 67.3\% Whites. Women had higher RAR amplitude and mesor, and also more robust (pseudo-F statistic), more stable (higher IS) and less fragmented (lower IV) RAR (all
                P
                trend
                ‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001) than men. Compared with younger adults (20‚Äì39‚Äâyears), older adults (‚â•‚Äâ60‚Äâyears) exhibited reduced RAR amplitude and mesor, but more stable and less fragmented RAR, and also reached their peak activity earlier (advanced acrophase) (all
                P
                trend
                ‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001). Relative to other racial/ethnic groups, Hispanics had the highest amplitude and mesor level, and most stable (highest IS) and least fragmented (lowest IV) RAR pattern (
                P
                trend
                ‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001). Conversely, non-Hispanic blacks had the lowest peak activity level (lowest amplitude) and least stable (lowest IS) RAR pattern (all
                P
                trend
                ‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001).
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              In the general adult population, RAR patterns vary significantly according to sex, age and race/ethnicity. These results may reflect demographic-dependent differences in intrinsic circadian rhythms and may have important implications for understanding racial, ethnic, sex and other disparities in morbidity and mortality risk.},

            We explored the associations of actigraphy-derived rest-activity patterns and circadian phase parameters with clinical symptoms and level 1 polysomnography (PSG) results in patients with chronic insomnia to evaluate the clinical implications of actigraphy-derived parameters for PSG interpretation. Seventy-five participants underwent actigraphy assessments and level 1 PSG. Exploratory correlation analyses between parameters derived from actigraphy, PSG, and clinical assessments were performed. First, participants were classified into two groups based on rest-activity pattern variables; group differences were investigated following covariate adjustment. Participants with poorer rest-activity patterns on actigraphy (low inter-day stability and high intra-daily variability) exhibited higher insomnia severity index scores than participants with better rest-activity patterns. No between-group differences in PSG parameters were observed. Second, participants were classified into two groups based on circadian phase variables. Late-phase participants (least active 5-h and most active 10-h onset times) exhibited higher insomnia severity scores, longer sleep and rapid eye movement latency, and lower apnea‚Äìhypopnea index than early-phase participants. These associations remained significant even after adjusting for potential covariates. Some actigraphy-derived rest-activity patterns and circadian phase parameters were significantly associated with clinical symptoms and PSG results, suggesting their possible adjunctive role in deriving plans for PSG lights-off time and assessing the possible insomnia pathophysiology.},

            The adaptive arm of the immune system facilitates recognition of specific foreign pathogens and, via the action of T and B lymphocytes, induces a fine-tuned response to target the pathogen and develop immunological memory. The functionality of the adaptive immune system exhibits daily 24-h variation both in homeostatic processes (such as lymphocyte trafficking and development of T lymphocyte subsets) and in responses to challenge. Here, we discuss how the circadian clock exerts influence over the function of the adaptive immune system, considering the roles of cell intrinsic clockwork machinery and cell extrinsic rhythmic signals. Inappropriate or misguided actions of the adaptive immune system can lead to development of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis. Growing evidence indicates that disturbance of the circadian clock has negative impact on development and progression of these chronic inflammatory diseases and we examine current understanding of clock-immune interactions in the setting of these inflammatory conditions. A greater appreciation of circadian control of adaptive immunity will facilitate further understanding of mechanisms driving daily variation in disease states and drive improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.},

            Chronic increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines in older adults, known as inflammaging, are an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality in the aging population. It has been suggested that circadian disruption may play a role in chronic inflammation, but there has been limited study that investigated the overall profile of 24-hour rest‚Äìactivity rhythms in relation to inflammation using longitudinal data. In the Outcomes of Sleep Disorders in Older Men Study, we applied the extended cosine model to derive multiple rest‚Äìactivity rhythm characteristics using multiday actigraphy, and examined their associations with 6 inflammatory markers (ie, C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-Œ±], tumor necrosis factor alpha soluble receptor II [TNF-Œ±-sRII], interleukin-1Œ≤ [IL-1Œ≤], interferon gamma [IFN-Œ≥]) measured from fasting blood. We assessed both the cross-sectional association between rest‚Äìactivity rhythms and inflammatory markers measured at baseline, and the prospective association between baseline rest‚Äìactivity rhythms and changes in inflammatory markers over 3.5 years of follow-up. We found that multiple rest‚Äìactivity characteristics, including lower amplitude and relative amplitude, and decreased overall rhythmicity, were associated with higher levels of CRP, IL-6, TNF-Œ±, and TNF-Œ±-sRII, but not IL-1Œ≤ and IFN-Œ≥ at baseline. Moreover, the lowest quartile of these 3 rest‚Äìactivity characteristics was associated with an approximately 2-fold increase in the odds of having elevated inflammation (ie, having 3 or more markers in the highest quartile) at baseline. However, we found little evidence supporting a relationship between rest‚Äìactivity rhythm characteristics and changes in inflammatory markers. Future studies should clarify the dynamic relationship between rest‚Äìactivity rhythms and inflammation in different populations, and evaluate the effects of improving rest‚Äìactivity profiles on inflammation and related disease outcomes.},

	abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has affected nearly 28 million people in the United States and has caused more than five hundred thousand deaths as of February 21, 2021. As the novel coronavirus continues to take its toll in the United States and all across the globe, particularly among the elderly (\&gt;65 years), clinicians and translational researchers are taking a closer look at the nexus of sleep, circadian rhythms and immunity that may contribute toward a more severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2-induced multi-organ failure affects both central and peripheral organs, causing increased mortality in the elderly. However, whether differences in sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity between older and younger individuals contribute to the age-related differences in systemic dysregulation of target organs observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unknown. Current literature demonstrates the emerging role of sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity in the development of chronic pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections in human and mouse models. The exact mechanism underlying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other cardiopulmonary complications in elderly patients in combination with associated comorbidities remain unclear. Nevertheless, understanding the critical role of sleep, circadian clock dysfunction in target organs, and immune status of patients with SARS-CoV-2 may provide novel insights into possible therapies. Chronotherapy is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in sleep medicine. Accumulating evidence suggests that nearly half of all physiological functions follow a strict daily rhythm. However, healthcare professionals rarely take implementing timed-administration of drugs into consideration. In this review, we summarize recent findings directly relating to the contributing roles of sleep, circadian rhythms and immune response in modulating infectious disease processes, and integrate chronotherapy in the discussion of the potential drugs that can be repurposed to improve the treatment and management of COVID-19.},

            Chronic increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines in older adults, known as inflammaging, are an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality in the aging population. It has been suggested that circadian disruption may play a role in chronic inflammation, but there has been limited study that investigated the overall profile of 24-hour rest‚Äìactivity rhythms in relation to inflammation using longitudinal data. In the Outcomes of Sleep Disorders in Older Men Study, we applied the extended cosine model to derive multiple rest‚Äìactivity rhythm characteristics using multiday actigraphy, and examined their associations with 6 inflammatory markers (ie, C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-Œ±], tumor necrosis factor alpha soluble receptor II [TNF-Œ±-sRII], interleukin-1Œ≤ [IL-1Œ≤], interferon gamma [IFN-Œ≥]) measured from fasting blood. We assessed both the cross-sectional association between rest‚Äìactivity rhythms and inflammatory markers measured at baseline, and the prospective association between baseline rest‚Äìactivity rhythms and changes in inflammatory markers over 3.5 years of follow-up. We found that multiple rest‚Äìactivity characteristics, including lower amplitude and relative amplitude, and decreased overall rhythmicity, were associated with higher levels of CRP, IL-6, TNF-Œ±, and TNF-Œ±-sRII, but not IL-1Œ≤ and IFN-Œ≥ at baseline. Moreover, the lowest quartile of these 3 rest‚Äìactivity characteristics was associated with an approximately 2-fold increase in the odds of having elevated inflammation (ie, having 3 or more markers in the highest quartile) at baseline. However, we found little evidence supporting a relationship between rest‚Äìactivity rhythm characteristics and changes in inflammatory markers. Future studies should clarify the dynamic relationship between rest‚Äìactivity rhythms and inflammation in different populations, and evaluate the effects of improving rest‚Äìactivity profiles on inflammation and related disease outcomes.},

              Background
              Alterations in circadian rhythms are present in the presymptomatic stage of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), possibly contributing to its pathogenesis. However, it is unknown whether such alterations are associated with worse outcomes once individuals are diagnosed with symptomatic disease. We aimed to evaluate the association between the circadian rest-activity pattern and AD-related features in patients with mild-moderate AD.
            
            
              Methods
              We assessed the circadian rest-activity pattern of consecutive patients with mild-moderate AD through actigraphy for 14‚Äâdays. Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained to determine the levels of important pathological markers including amyloid-beta protein (AŒ≤42), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), total tau (T-tau), and neurofilament light (NF-L). Neuropsychological evaluation was conducted at the beginning of the study and after 12‚Äâmonths of follow-up. Linear regression models were performed considering the global population and AŒ≤42+ patients only.
            
            
              Results
              
                The cohort included 100 patients with mild-moderate AD. The median age [p
                25
                ;p
                75
                ] was 76.0 [73.0;80.0] years and 63.0\% were female. Older age (effect size [SE] of 0.324 [0.096];
                p
                = 0.001) and male sex (0.780 [0.193];
                p
                = 0.001) were associated with increased fragmentation and decreased synchronization of the rhythm, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, and season of the year, increased levels of T-tau (effect size [95\% CI] of 0.343 [0.139 to 0.547];
                p
                = 0.001) and NF-L (0.444 [0.212 to 0.676];
                p
                = 0.001) were associated with a higher amplitude of the rest-activity rhythm. Increased fragmentation of the rhythm at baseline was associated with greater cognitive decline after one year of follow-up independent of age, sex, T-tau/AŒ≤42 ratio, educational level, and season of the year (‚àí 0.715 [‚àí 1.272 to ‚àí 0.157];
                p
                = 0.013). Similar findings were obtained considering only the AŒ≤42+ patients.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our results suggest a potential role of the circadian rest-activity pattern in predicting the cognitive decline of patients with mild-moderate AD. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and to elucidate whether there is causality among the observed associations.},

            Altered 24-hour rest‚Äìactivity rhythms may be associated with cognitive impairment in older adults, but evidence from prospective studies is limited. Nonparametric methods were used to assess actigraphy-based activity patterns in 2 496 older men. Incident cognitive impairment was assessed 4 times over 12 years using the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) and Trails B tests, self-reported medication use, and clinical diagnosis. The highest quartile (vs the lowest) of intradaily variability and the lowest quartiles (vs the highest) of interdaily stability and relative amplitude were associated with incident cognitive impairment (hazard ratio [95\% confidence interval]: 1.82 [1.31‚Äì2.53], 1.36 [0.99‚Äì1.86], and 1.85 [1.33‚Äì2.56], respectively). A larger increase in intradaily variability over 7.5 years was associated with a greater subsequent decline in 3MS scores but not in Trails B performance. In conclusion, less stable and more variable rest‚Äìactivity rhythms may represent early biomarkers of cognitive impairment in older men.},

            White matter lesions (WMLs) are common in older adults and represent an important predictor of negative long-term outcomes. Rest-activity rhythm disturbance is also common, however, few studies have investigated associations between these factors. We employed a novel AI-based automatic WML segmentation tool and diffusion-weighted tractography to investigate associations between tract specific WML volumes and non-parametric actigraphy measures in older adults at risk for cognitive decline. The primary non-parametric measures of interest were inter-daily stability (IS), intra-daily variability and relative amplitude, with the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) selected as tracts of interest. One hundred and eight participants at risk for cognitive decline (classified as experiencing subjective or objective cognitive decline) were included (mean age‚Äâ=‚Äâ68.85 years, SD‚Äâ=‚Äâ8.91). Of the primary non-parametric measures of interest, results showed that lower IS was associated with a greater likelihood of higher WML burden in the ATR (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.82, 95\% CI [1.12,3.15]). Analysis of secondary non-parametric measures revealed later onset of the least active period to be associated with greater likelihood of high WML burden in the SLF (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.55, 95\% CI [1.00,2.53]) and increased activity during the least active 5-h period to be associated with a greater likelihood of high whole-brain WML burden (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.83, 95\% CI [1.06,3.47]). This study shows integrity of the ATR and SLF, and overall WML burden is linked to altered rest-activity rhythms in older adults at risk for cognitive decline, with those demonstrating altered rest-activity rhythms showing 50\%-80\% higher odds of having high WML burden.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The use of digital tools to measure physiological and behavioural variables of potential relevance to mental health is a growing field sitting at the intersection between computer science, engineering, and clinical science. We summarised the literature on remote measuring technologies, mapping methodological challenges and threats to reproducibility, and identified leading digital signals for depression. Medical and computer science databases were searched between January 2007 and November 2019. Published studies linking depression and objective behavioural data obtained from smartphone and wearable device sensors in adults with unipolar depression and healthy subjects were included. A descriptive approach was taken to synthesise study methodologies. We included 51 studies and found threats to reproducibility and transparency arising from failure to provide comprehensive descriptions of recruitment strategies, sample information, feature construction and the determination and handling of missing data. The literature is characterised by small sample sizes, short follow-up duration and great variability in the quality of reporting, limiting the interpretability of pooled results. Bivariate analyses show consistency in statistically significant associations between depression and digital features from sleep, physical activity, location, and phone use data. Machine learning models found the predictive value of aggregated features. Given the pitfalls in the combined literature, these results should be taken purely as a starting point for hypothesis generation. Since this research is ultimately aimed at informing clinical practice, we recommend improvements in reporting standards including consideration of generalisability and reproducibility, such as wider diversity of samples, thorough reporting methodology and the reporting of potential bias in studies with numerous features.},

	abstract = {Background
              Skin cancer, including melanoma and non-melanoma (keratinocyte), is increasing in incidence in the UK. Accounting for half of all cancers in England and Wales, the disease significantly impacts overstretched dermatology services. Research suggests that 86\% of melanoma is preventable with modified sun exposure. Educating children about sun safety in schools can help prevent skin cancer and is recommended by major health organisations. In England, teaching sun safety in primary schools is compulsory, while in Wales this is left to school discretion.
            
            
              Aims
              Understand how primary schools in Wales are responding to growing skin cancer rates and explore the effectiveness of sun safety policies in schools on knowledge and behaviour.
            
            
              Methods
              Sunproofed is a mixed-methods scoping study comprising 5 work packages (WP) using survey and routine electronic health record (EHR) data supplemented by qualitative case studies. Objective(s) are to: WP1: Discover if primary schools in Wales have sun safety policies; policy characteristics; determine factors that may influence their presence and identify areas where schools need support. WP2: Determine what EHR data is available regarding the incidence of sunburn in primary school children and the feasibility of using this data to evaluate the impact of sun safety policies. WP3: Understand the impact of sun safety policies on sun-safe knowledge and behaviour amongst children, parents, teachers, and school management; identify barriers and facilitators to schools implementing sun safety policies. WP4: Co-produce guidance regarding sun safety policies and best methods for implementation in schools. WP5: Disseminate guidance and findings widely to ensure impact and uptake.
            
            
              Discussion
              Skin cancer rates are increasing in the UK, straining limited resources. Sunproofed has the potential to inform the development of future prevention activities, both in Wales and beyond. This could reduce the number of skin cancer cases in the future and keep people healthier for longer.},

However, data on IPC compliance among healthcare workers in COVID-19 treatment centers are unknown in Ghana. This study aims to assess IPC compliance among healthcare workers in Ghana‚Äôs COVID-19 treatment centers. The study was a secondary analysis of data, which was initially collected to determine the level of risk of COVID-19 virus infection among healthcare workers in Ghana. Quantitative data were conveniently collected using the WHO COVID-19 risk assessment tool. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses. We observed that IPC compliance during healthcare interactions was 88.4\% for hand hygiene and 90.6\% for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) usage; IPC compliance while performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), was 97.5\% for hand hygiene and 97.5\% for PPE usage. For hand hygiene during healthcare interactions, lower compliance was seen among nonclinical staff [OR (odds ratio): 0.43; 95\% CI (Confidence interval): 0.21‚Äì0.89], and healthcare workers with secondary level qualification (OR: 0.24; 95\% CI: 0.08‚Äì0.71). Midwives (OR: 0.29; 95\% CI: 0.09‚Äì0.93) and Pharmacists (OR: 0.15; 95\% CI: 0.02‚Äì0.92) compliance with hand hygiene was significantly lower than registered nurses. For PPE usage during healthcare interactions, lower compliance was seen among healthcare workers who were separated/divorced/widowed (OR: 0.08; 95\% CI: 0.01‚Äì0.43), those with secondary level qualifications (OR 0.08; 95\% CI 0.01‚Äì0.43), non-clinical staff (OR 0.16 95\% CI 0.07‚Äì0.35), cleaners (OR: 0.16; 95\% CI: 0.05‚Äì0.52), pharmacists (OR: 0.07; 95\% CI: 0.01‚Äì0.49) and among healthcare workers who reported of insufficiency of PPEs (OR: 0.33; 95\% CI: 0.14‚Äì0.77). Generally, healthcare workers‚Äô infection prevention and control compliance were high, but this compliance differs across the different groups of health professionals in the treatment centers. Ensuring an adequate supply of IPC logistics coupled with behavior change interventions and paying particular attention to nonclinical staff is critical in minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the treatment centers.},

	abstract = {While the world awaits a widely available COVID-19 vaccine, availability of testing is limited in many regions and can be further compounded by shortages of reagents, prolonged processing time and delayed results. One approach to rapid testing is to leverage the volatile organic compound (VOC) signature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Detection dogs, a biological sensor of VOCs, were utilized to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 positive urine and saliva patient samples had a unique odor signature. The virus was inactivated in all training samples with either detergent or heat treatment. Using detergent-inactivated urine samples, dogs were initially trained to find samples collected from hospitalized patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, while ignoring samples collected from controls. Dogs were then tested on their ability to spontaneously recognize heat-treated urine samples as well as heat-treated saliva from hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Dogs successfully discriminated between infected and uninfected urine samples, regardless of the inactivation protocol, as well as heat-treated saliva samples. Generalization to novel samples was limited, particularly after intensive training with a restricted sample set. A unique odor associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection present in human urine as well as saliva, provides impetus for the development of odor-based screening, either by electronic, chemical, or biological sensing methods. The use of dogs for screening in an operational setting will require training with a large number of novel SARS-CoV-2 positive and confirmed negative samples.},

	abstract = {Background
              Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) is an emerging healthcare burden. The risk factors associated with PACS remain largely unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of new or persistent symptoms in COVID-19 patients post hospital discharge and identify associated risk factors.
            
            
              Methods
              Our prospective cohort comprised of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between May and July 2020. The patients were interviewed through phone calls by trained physicians from 6 weeks up to 6 months post hospital discharge. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models were used to examine for predictors associated with persistence of symptoms and non-return to baseline health.
            
            
              Results
              222 COVID-19 patients responded to follow-up phone interviews after a median of 122 days post discharge. The majority of patients were men (77\%) with mean age of 52.47 (¬± 13.95) years. 56.3\% of patients complained of persistent symptoms; 66 (29.7\%) experiencing them for {\textgreater}21 days and 64 (28.8\%) reporting not having returned to their baseline health. Furthermore, 39 patients (17.6\%) reported visiting an emergency room post discharge for COVID-19-related symptoms while 16 (7.2\%) had required re-hospitalization. Shortness of breath (40.1\%), cough (27.5\%) and fatigue (29.7\%) were the most frequently reported symptoms at follow-up. After multivariable adjustments, female gender, pre-existing hypertension and length of hospital stay were associated with an increased risk of new or persistent symptoms. Age, pre-existing lung disease and emergency room visits increased the likelihood of not fully recovering from acute COVID-19. Patients who were treated with interferon Œ≤-1b based triple antiviral therapy during hospital stay were less likely to experience new or persistent symptoms and more likely to return to their baseline health.
            
            
              Conclusions
              COVID-19 survivors continued to suffer from dyspnea, cough and fatigue at 4 months post hospital discharge. Several risk factors could predict which patients are more likely to experience PACS and may benefit from individualized follow-up and rehabilitation programs.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Severe and moderate acute malnutrition (SAM and MAM) affect more than 50 million children worldwide yet 80\% of these children do not access care. The Combined Protocol for Acute Malnutrition Study (ComPAS) trial assessed the effectiveness of a simplified, combined SAM/MAM protocol for children aged 6‚Äì59 months and found non-inferior recovery compared to standard care. To further inform policy, this study assessed post-discharge outcomes of children treated with this novel protocol in Kenya.
            
            
              Methods
              Six ‚Äòcombined‚Äô protocol clinics treated SAM and MAM children using an optimised mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC)-based dose of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF). Six ‚Äòstandard care‚Äô clinics treated SAM with weight-based RUTF rations; MAM with ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF). Four months post-discharge, we assessed anthropometry, recent history of illness, and body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Data was analysed using multivariable linear regression, adjusted for age, sex and allowing for clustering by clinic.
            
            
              Results
              We sampled 850 children (median age 18 months, IQR 15‚Äì23); 44\% of the original trial sample in Kenya. Children treated with the combined protocol had similar anthropometry, fat-free mass, fat mass, skinfold thickness z-scores, and frequency of common illnesses 4 months post-discharge compared the standard protocol. Mean subscapular skinfold z-scores were close to the global norm (standard care: 0.24; combined 0.27). There was no significant difference in odds of relapse between protocols (SAM, 3\% vs 3\%, OR = 1.0 p = 0.75; MAM, 10\% vs 12\%, OR = 0.90 p = 0.34).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Despite the lower dosage of RUTF for most SAM children in the combined protocol, their anthropometry and relapse rates at 4 months post-discharge were similar to standard care. MAM children treated with RUTF had similar body composition to those treated with RUSF and neither group exhibited excess adiposity. These results add further evidence that a combined protocol is as effective as standard care with no evidence of adverse effects post-discharge. A simplified, combined approach could treat more children, stretch existing resources further, and contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal Two.},

	abstract = {Background
              Exposure to trauma can result in various mental health disorders including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies exist for the treatment of these disorders, many individuals fail to receive treatment and among those who do, many remain symptomatic. Therefore, it is critical to continue developing new interventions for traumatic stress that target underlying mechanisms of pathology and offer a safe and acceptable alternative to current treatments. Morning light treatment has good potential as a novel non-invasive, low risk treatment for traumatic stress. Evidence suggests that morning light may improve traumatic stress by reducing reactivity in the amygdala, a brain region implicated in the pathophysiology of PTSD and anatomically linked to circadian photoreceptors in the eye.
            
            
              Methods
              In this study, we aim to establish a significant dose-response relationship between duration of morning light treatment and reduction in amygdala reactivity among individuals with traumatic stress symptoms (NCT\# 04117347). Using a transdiagnostic approach, sixty-six individuals with a history of a DSM-5 criterion A trauma and traumatic stress symptoms will be recruited to participate in a 5-week study. Participants will be randomized across three treatment arms based on morning light treatment duration: 15-minutes, 30-minutes, or 60-minutes of light treatment per day for four weeks. To evaluate amygdala activity, participants will undergo fMRI at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and post-treatment. Participants will also complete clinical assessments and self-report measures of PTSD, depression, and anxiety at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and post-treatment.
            
            
              Discussion
              Morning light therapy may be an acceptable, feasible, and effective treatment for individuals suffering from traumatic stress. Identifying mechanistically relevant targets, and the doses needed to impact them, are critical steps in developing this new treatment approach for the sequelae of traumatic stress.},

	abstract = {Background
              The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to a mental health crisis on a global scale. Epidemiological studies have reported a drastic increase in mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, increased loneliness and feelings of disconnectedness from others, while resilience levels have been negatively affected, indicating an urgent need for intervention. The current study is embedded within the larger CovSocial project which sought to evaluate longitudinal changes in vulnerability, resilience and social cohesion during the pandemic. The current second phase will investigate the efficacy of brief online mental training interventions in reducing mental health problems, and enhancing psychological resilience and social capacities. It further provides a unique opportunity for the prediction of intervention effects by individual biopsychosocial characteristics and preceding longitudinal change patterns during the pandemic in 2020/21.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We will examine the differential effects of a socio-emotional (including ‚ÄòAffect Dyad‚Äô) and a mindfulness-based (including ‚ÄòBreathing Meditation‚Äô) intervention, delivered through a web- and cellphone application. Participants will undergo 10 weeks of intervention, and will be compared to a retest control group. The effectiveness of the interventions will be evaluated in a community sample (
                N
                = 300), which is recruited from the original longitudinal CovSocial sample. The pre- to post-intervention changes, potential underlying mechanisms, and prediction thereof, will be assessed on a wide range of outcomes: levels of stress, loneliness, depression and anxiety, resilience, prosocial behavior, empathy, compassion, and the impact on neuroendocrine, immunological and epigenetic markers. The multi-method nature of the study will incorporate self-report questionnaires, behavioral tasks, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approaches, and biological, hormonal and epigenetic markers assessed in saliva.
              
            
            
              Discussion
              Results will reveal the differential effectiveness of two brief online interventions in improving mental health outcomes, as well as enhancing social capacities and resilience. The present study will serve as a first step for future application of scalable, low-cost interventions at a broader level to reduce stress and loneliness, improve mental health and build resilience and social capacities in the face of global stressors.

	abstract = {Introduction
              Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects approximately 0.5\%‚Äì1\% of the general population. Clinically significant interstitial lung diseases (ILD) develops in just under 10\% of people with RA, and subclinical disease is more common. Little is known about RA-ILD in New Zealand (NZ), or the number of persons with RA in Canterbury, NZ. This study aims to determine: (1) incidence and prevalence of RA, (2) incidence and prevalence of RA-ILD, (3) clinical characteristics and risk factors for the development of RA-ILD, (4) long-term outcomes of RA-ILD, in the population resident within the Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB) catchment area.
            
            
              Methods and analysis
              Persons aged 18 years of age and older, and resident in the region covered by the CDHB with RA as well as RA-ILD will be identified by retrospective review of medical records. Prevalent as well as incident cases of RA between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2008 and between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2013 will be identified, and followed until 30 June 2019. Existing as well as incident cases of RA-ILD during this time will be identified. The association between the development of ILD and clinical characteristics and environmental exposures will be examined using Cox-proportional hazard models. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to estimate survival rates for patients with RA-ILD. Mortality for people with RA and RA-ILD will also be compared with the general population of the CDHB.
            
            
              Ethics and dissemination
              Data will be obtained by retrospective review of medical records. Deidentified patient data will be stored in a secure online database. Data on individual patients will not be released, and all results will only be published in aggregate. Ethical approval has been obtained from the University of Otago Human Research Ethics Committee (REF HD18/079).

	abstract = {Introduction
              Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain conditions, a leading cause of global disability, are usually first managed in primary care settings such as medical, physiotherapy, and chiropractic community-based practices. While chiropractors often treat MSK conditions, there is limited real-world evidence on the topic of health service outcomes among patients receiving this type of care. A nationwide Swiss chiropractic practice-based research network (PBRN) and MSK pain patient cohort study will have potential to monitor the epidemiological trends of MSK pain conditions and contribute to healthcare quality improvement. The primary aims of this protocol are to (1) describe the development of an MSK-focused PBRN within the Swiss chiropractic setting, and (2) describe the methodology of the first nested study to be conducted within the PBRN‚Äîan observational prospective patient cohort pilot study.
            
            
              Methods and analysis
              This initiative is conceptualised with two distinct phases. Phase I focuses on the development of the Swiss chiropractic PBRN, and will use a cross-sectional design to collect information from chiropractic clinicians nationwide. Phase II will recruit consecutive patients aged 18 years or older with MSK pain from community-based chiropractic practices participating in the PBRN into a prospective chiropractic cohort pilot study. All data collection will occur through electronic surveys offered in the three Swiss official languages (German, French, Italian) and English. Surveys will be provided to patients prior to their initial consultation in clinics, 1‚Äâhour after initial consultation, and at 2, 6 and 12 weeks after initial consultation.
            
            
              Ethics and dissemination
              Ethics approval has been obtained from the independent research ethics committee of Canton Zurich (BASEC-Nr: 2021-01479). Informed consent will be obtained electronically from all participants. Findings will be reported to stakeholders after each study phase, presented at local and international conferences, and disseminated through peer-reviewed publications.

	abstract = {Introduction
              Pioneers have shown that it is possible to reconstruct a full breast using just autologous fat harvested by liposuction or autologous fat transfer (AFT). This study describes the first multicentre randomised study protocol to thoroughly investigate the effectiveness of AFT to reconstruct full breasts following mastectomy procedures (primarily and delayed).
            
            
              Methods and analysis
              This study is designed as a multicentre, randomised controlled clinical superiority trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio. A total of 196 patients (98 patients per treatment arm) are aimed to be included. Patients who wish to undergo breast reconstruction with either one of the two techniques are randomly allocated into the AFT group (intervention) or the tissue-expander/prosthesis group (control). The primary outcome measure for the quality of life is measured by the validated BREAST-Q questionnaire.
            
            
              Ethics and dissemination
              Approval for this study was obtained from the medical ethics committee of Maastricht University Medical Centre/Maastricht University; the trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. The results of this randomised controlled trial will be presented at scientific meetings as abstracts for poster or oral presentations and published in peer-reviewed journals.

To date, no data exist on its application in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \textbf{\textit{Objectives:}} The aim of this article was to describe the TSE pattern in patients with COPD and healthy subjects, either smokers or nonsmokers, and evaluate the feasibility of this technique for early detection of COPD in smokers. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} Nineteen patients with COPD, twenty-one healthy smokers, and twenty healthy nonsmokers underwent spirometry and TSE. Elastosonography was performed by one ultrasound-certified operator on 12 different scans for each participant, on right and left sides, anteriorly and posteriorly, on upper and lower lobes. For each scan, lung-pleura interface stiffness index (SI) was calculated, and the average SI on all 12 scans (SI-12) and on posterior basal scans (SI-PB) was calculated and used for comparisons among groups of participants and correlations with spirometric parameters. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} Patients with lung injury (i.e., with COPD or healthy smokers) exhibited significantly increased lung-pleura interface stiffness on TSE, measured by SI-12 and SI-PB, than healthy nonsmokers (\textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.05). Unlike SI-12, SI-PB was able to discriminate between subjects with lung injury and healthy nonsmokers on receiver operating characteristics analysis (area under the curve 0.846, 95\% confidence interval 0.730‚Äì0.926, \textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.001) and correlated with forced expiratory volume in the first second (\textit{r} = ‚àí0.31, \textit{p} = 0.018). \textbf{\textit{Conclusion:}} The measurement of lung-pleura interface stiffness by TSE in posterior basal scans was able to discriminate patients with lung injury from healthy nonsmokers. The role of TSE for detecting early lung damage in COPD should be further investigated.},

The data required for this is gathered by comprehensive long-term longitudinal studies. This article describes the protocol of the Zurich Longitudinal Studies (ZLS), a set of three comprehensive cohort studies on child growth, health, and development that are currently expanding into adulthood. Between 1954 and 1961, 445 healthy infants were enrolled in the first ZLS cohort. Their physical, motor, cognitive, and social development and their environment were assessed comprehensively across childhood, adolescence, and into young adulthood. In the 1970s, two further cohorts were added to the ZLS and assessed with largely matched study protocols: Between 1974 and 1979, the second ZLS cohort included 265 infants (103 term-born and 162 preterm infants), and between 1970 and 2002, the third ZLS cohort included 327 children of participants of the first ZLS cohort. Since 2019, the participants of the three ZLS cohorts have been traced and invited to participate in a first wave of assessments in adulthood to investigate their current health and development. This article describes the ZLS study protocol and discusses opportunities, methodological and conceptual challenges, and limitations arising from a long-term longitudinal cohort recruited from a study about development in early life. In the future, the ZLS will provide data to investigate childhood antecedents of adult health outcomes and, ultimately, will help respond to the frequent call of scientists to shift the focus of aging research into the first decades of life and, thus, to take a lifespan perspective on aging.},

              Objectives
              To examine longitudinal changes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence and to determine the clustering of children who were seropositive within school classes in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland from June to November 2020.
            
            
              Design
              Prospective cohort study.
            
            
              Setting
              Switzerland had one of the highest second waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe in autumn 2020. Keeping schools open provided a moderate to high exposure environment to study SARS-CoV-2 infections. Children from randomly selected schools and classes, stratified by district, were invited for serological testing of SARS-CoV-2. Parents completed questionnaires on sociodemographic and health related questions.
            
            
              Participants
              275 classes in 55 schools; 2603 children participated in June-July 2020 and 2552 in October-November 2020 (age range 6-16 years).
            
            
              Main outcome measures
              Serology of SARS-CoV-2 in June-July and October-November 2020, clustering of children who were seropositive within classes, and symptoms in children.
            
            
              Results
              In June-July, 74 of 2496 children with serological results were seropositive; in October-November, the number had increased to 173 of 2503. Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4\% (95\% credible interval 1.4\% to 3.6\%) in the summer and 4.5\% (3.2\% to 6.0\%) in late autumn in children who were not previously seropositive, leading to an estimated 7.8\% (6.2\% to 9.5\%) of children who were ever seropositive. Seroprevalence varied across districts (in the autumn, 1.7-15.0\%). No significant differences were found among lower, middle, and upper school levels (children aged 6-9 years, 9-13 years, and 12-16 years, respectively). Among the 2223 children who had serology tests at both testing rounds, 28/70 (40\%) who were previously seropositive became seronegative, and 109/2153 (5\%) who were previously seronegative became seropositive. Symptoms were reported for 22\% of children who were seronegative and 29\% of children who were newly seropositive since the summer. Between July and November 2020, the ratio of children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection to those who were seropositive was 1 to 8. At least one child who was newly seropositive was detected in 47 of 55 schools and in 90 of 275 classes. Among 130 classes with a high participation rate, no children who were seropositive were found in 73 (56\%) classes, one or two children were seropositive in 50 (38\%) classes, and at least three children were seropositive in 7 (5\%) classes. Class level explained 24\% and school level 8\% of variance in seropositivity in the multilevel logistic regression models.
            
            
              Conclusions
              With schools open since August 2020 and some preventive measures in place, clustering of children who were seropositive occurred in only a few classes despite an increase in overall seroprevalence during a period of moderate to high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. Uncertainty remains as to whether these findings will change with the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and dynamic levels of community transmission.

              Background
              Worldwide, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), fetal growth restriction (FGR) and preterm birth remain the leading causes of maternal and fetal pregnancy-related mortality and (long-term) morbidity. Fetal cardiac deformation changes can be the first sign of placental dysfunction, which is associated with HDP, FGR and preterm birth. In addition, preterm birth is likely associated with changes in electrical activity across the uterine muscle. Therefore, fetal cardiac function and uterine activity can be used for the early detection of these complications in pregnancy. Fetal cardiac function and uterine activity can be assessed by two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE), non-invasive fetal electrocardiography (NI-fECG), and electrohysterography (EHG). This study aims to generate reference values for 2D-STE, NI-fECG and EHG parameters during the second trimester of pregnancy and to investigate the diagnostic potential of these parameters in the early detection of HDP, FGR and preterm birth.
            
            
              Methods
              In this longitudinal prospective cohort study, eligible women will be recruited from a tertiary care hospital and a primary midwifery practice. In total, 594 initially healthy pregnant women with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy will be included. Recordings of NI-fECG and EHG will be made weekly from 22 until 28 weeks of gestation and 2D-STE measurements will be performed 4-weekly at 16, 20, 24 and 28 weeks gestational age. Retrospectively, pregnancies complicated with pregnancy-related diseases will be excluded from the cohort. Reference values for 2D-STE, NI-fECG and EHG parameters will be assessed in uncomplicated pregnancies.

	abstract = {Introduction
              Ileus is a common and distressing condition characterised by gut dysfunction after surgery. While a number of interventions have aimed to curtail its impact on patients and healthcare systems, ileus is still an unmet challenge. Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve is a promising new treatment due to its role in modulating the neuro-immune axis through a novel anti-inflammatory reflex. The protocol for a feasibility study of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS), and a programme of mechanistic and qualitative studies, is described.
            
            
              Methods and analysis
              This is a participant-blinded, parallel-group, randomised, sham-controlled feasibility trial (IDEAL Stage 2b) of self-administered nVNS. One hundred forty patients planned for elective, minimally invasive, colorectal surgery will be randomised to four schedules of nVNS before and after surgery. Feasibility outcomes include assessments of recruitment and attrition, adequacy of blinding and compliance to the intervention. Clinical outcomes include bowel function and length of hospital stay. A series of mechanistic substudies exploring the impact of nVNS on inflammation and bowel motility will inform the design of the final stimulation schedule. Semistructured interviews with participants will explore experiences and perceptions of the intervention, while interviews with patients who decline participation will explore barriers to recruitment.
            
            
              Ethics and dissemination
              The protocol has been approved by the Tyne and Wear South National Health Service (NHS) Research Ethics Committee (19/NE/0217) on 2 July 2019. Feasibility, mechanistic and qualitative findings will be disseminated to national and international partners through peer-reviewed publications, academic conferences, social media channels and stakeholder engagement activities. The findings will build a case for or against progression to a definitive randomised assessment as well as informing key elements of study design.

Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated among trial participants. Methods Adults with NSCLC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 1 were randomly assigned cemiplimab 350 mg every 3 weeks or platinum-doublet chemotherapy. At baseline and day 1 of each treatment cycle, patients were administered the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and Lung Cancer Module (QLQ-LC13) questionnaires. Mixed-model repeated measures analysis estimated overall change from baseline for PD-L1 ‚â•50\% and intention-to-treat populations. Kaplan‚ÄìMeier analysis estimated time to definitive deterioration. Results In PD-L1 ‚â•50\% patients (cemiplimab, n = 283; chemotherapy, n = 280), baseline QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 scores showed moderate-to-high functioning and low symptom burden. Change from baseline favored cemiplimab on global health status/quality of life (GHS/QOL), functioning, and most symptom scales. Risk of definitive deterioration across functioning scales was reduced versus chemotherapy; hazard ratios were 0.48 (95\% CI, 0.32-0.71) to 0.63 (95\% CI, 0.41-0.96). Cemiplimab showed lower risk of definitive deterioration for disease-related (dyspnea, cough, pain in chest, pain in other body parts, fatigue) and treatment-related symptoms (peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, nausea/vomiting, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea) (nominal p {\textless} .05). Results were similar in the intention-to-treat population. Conclusions Results support cemiplimab for first-line therapy of advanced NSCLC from the patient's perspective. Improved survival is accompanied by improvements versus platinum-doublet chemotherapy in GHS/QOL and functioning and reduction in symptom burden.},

	abstract = {Background
              Pregnancy and motherhood increase the risk for long-term exposure to physical, psychological and sexual intimate partner violence (IPV; sexual or physical violence by current or former partners). Pregnant women and mothers with children under 5 who have experienced IPV exhibit poor physical and mental health and obstetric outcomes. Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are the two most common mental health consequences of IPV. There is good evidence that women with good social support have better mental health and IPV outcomes.
            
            
              Methods
              This study will develop MOthers‚Äô AdvocateS In the Community (MOSAIC) Plus intervention for pregnant women and mothers with children under the age of 5. MOSAIC uses trained mentor mothers and has been found to reduce subsequent IPV. This study will blend the original MOSAIC intervention with principles of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) to address symptoms of depression, PTSD, and prevent subsequent risk of IPV. We will conduct a pilot randomized trial of the MOSAIC Plus intervention compared to the traditional MOSAIC intervention to determine its feasibility and acceptability. Study samples include focus groups (n = 36), open trial (n = 15), and a randomized pilot trial including 40 pregnant women and mothers with children under 5 who report current/recent of IPV and elevated symptoms of maternal depression and/or PTSD. The study‚Äôs primary outcome will be changes in maternal depressive and PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include reduction in subsequent IPV, improvement in functioning, changes in social support and effectiveness in obtaining resources.
            
            
              Discussion
              This is a formative study evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of a mentor mother intervention for pregnant women and mothers with children under 5. Promising results of this study will be used for a larger, fully-powered randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of a mentor mother intervention in preventing subsequent IPV and reducing depressive and PTSD symptoms in this population.},

	abstract = {Background
              The overuse and abuse of antibiotics is a major risk factor for antibiotic resistance in primary care settings of China. In this study, the effectiveness of an automatically-presented, privacy-protecting, computer information technology (IT)-based antibiotic feedback intervention will be evaluated to determine whether it can reduce antibiotic prescribing rates and unreasonable prescribing behaviours.
            
            
              Methods
              We will pilot and develop a cluster-randomised, open controlled, crossover, superiority trial. A total of 320 outpatient physicians in 6 counties of Guizhou province who met the standard will be randomly divided into intervention group and control group with a primary care hospital being the unit of cluster allocation. In the intervention group, the three components of the feedback intervention included: 1. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based real-time warnings of improper antibiotic use; 2. Pop-up windows of antibiotic prescription rate ranking; 3. Distribution of educational manuals. In the control group, no form of intervention will be provided. The trial will last for 6 months and will be divided into two phases of three months each. The two groups will crossover after 3 months. The primary outcome is the 10-day antibiotic prescription rate of physicians. The secondary outcome is the rational use of antibiotic prescriptions. The acceptability and feasibility of this feedback intervention study will be evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative assessment methods.
            
            
              Discussion
              This study will overcome limitations of our previous study, which only focused on reducing antibiotic prescription rates. AI techniques and an educational intervention will be used in this study to effectively reduce antibiotic prescription rates and antibiotic irregularities. This study will also provide new ideas and approaches for further research in this area.

	abstract = {Health maintenance and disease prevention strategies become increasingly prioritized with increasing health and economic burden of chronic, lifestyle-related diseases. A key element in these strategies is the empowerment of individuals to control their health. Self-measurement plays an essential role in achieving such empowerment. Digital measurements have the advantage of being measured non-invasively, passively, continuously, and in a real-world context. An important question is whether such measurement can sensitively measure subtle disbalances in the progression toward disease, as well as the subtle effects of, for example, nutritional improvement. The concept of resilience biomarkers, defined as the dynamic evaluation of the biological response to an external challenge, has been identified as a viable strategy to measure these subtle effects. In this review, we explore the potential of integrating this concept with digital physiological measurements to come to digital resilience biomarkers. Additionally, we discuss the potential of wearable, non-invasive, and continuous measurement of molecular biomarkers. These types of innovative measurements may, in the future, also serve as a digital resilience biomarker to provide even more insight into the personal biological dynamics of an individual. Altogether, digital resilience biomarkers are envisioned to allow for the measurement of subtle effects of health maintenance and disease prevention strategies in a real-world context and thereby give personalized feedback to improve health.},

	abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex neurobiological disorder characterized by a pathologic mood swing. Digital phenotyping, defined as the ‚Äòmoment-by-moment quantification of the individual-level human phenotype in its own environment‚Äô, represents a new approach aimed at measuring the human behavior and may theoretically enhance clinicians‚Äô capability in early identification, diagnosis, and management of any mental health conditions, including BD. Moreover, a digital phenotyping approach may easily introduce and allow clinicians to perform a more personalized and patient-tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approach, in line with the framework of precision psychiatry. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the role of digital phenotyping in BD. Despite scarce literature published so far, extremely heterogeneous methodological strategies, and limitations, digital phenotyping may represent a grounding research and clinical field in BD, by owning the potentialities to quickly identify, diagnose, longitudinally monitor, and evaluating clinical response and remission to psychotropic drugs. Finally, digital phenotyping might potentially constitute a possible predictive marker for mood disorders.},

	abstract = {The use of data generated passively by personal electronic devices, such as smartphones, to measure human function in health and disease has generated significant research interest. Particularly in psychiatry, objective, continuous quantitation using patients‚Äô own devices may result in clinically useful markers that can be used to refine diagnostic processes, tailor treatment choices, improve condition monitoring for actionable outcomes, such as early signs of relapse, and develop new intervention models. If a principal goal for digital phenotyping is clinical improvement, research needs to attend now to factors that will help or hinder future clinical adoption. We identify four opportunities for research directed toward this goal: exploring intermediate outcomes and underlying disease mechanisms; focusing on purposes that are likely to be used in clinical practice; anticipating quality and safety barriers to adoption; and exploring the potential for digital personalized medicine arising from the integration of digital phenotyping and digital interventions. Clinical relevance also means explicitly addressing consumer needs, preferences, and acceptability as the ultimate users of digital phenotyping interventions. There is a risk that, without such considerations, the potential benefits of digital phenotyping are delayed or not realized because approaches that are feasible for application in healthcare, and the evidence required to support clinical commissioning, are not developed. Practical steps to accelerate this research agenda include the further development of digital phenotyping technology platforms focusing on scalability and equity, establishing shared data repositories and common data standards, and fostering multidisciplinary collaborations between clinical stakeholders (including patients), computer scientists, and researchers.},

Flares were defined as an increase in DAS28, compared with the previous value of {\textgreater} 1.2 or {\textgreater} 0.6, if the concurrent DAS28 was ‚â• 3.2. Cox regression analysis was used to identify baseline predictors of flares. Of the 1.717 patients with RA, 566 (33.0\%) experienced flares during the 2-year study period. An analysis of baseline characteristics of flare and non-flare groups revealed that more women and non-smokers were present in the flare group than in the non-flare group; the flare group also had higher scores on physician‚Äôs and patient‚Äôs pain and fatigue visual analogue scales (VAS) and the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ). In a multivariate analysis, physician‚Äôs VAS score, hemoglobin level, and HAQ score were significant predictors of flares.

Multiple GPP subtypes have been described, from acute GPP of von Zumbusch to milder, annular pustular psoriasis. Generalized pustular psoriasis mainly affects adults, with a female preponderance, but juvenile GPP also occurs. Flares are a hallmark of GPP and may occur de novo or be provoked by triggers, including withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids, infections, stress, pregnancy, and menstruation. Severity of flares varies widely between patients, and between flares in an individual patient. Significant flares are often accompanied by systemic symptoms, notably fever, general malaise, and extracutaneous manifestations such as arthritis, uveitis, and neutrophilic cholangitis. Common laboratory abnormalities include neutrophilia, elevated C-reactive protein levels, hypocalcemia, and abnormal liver function tests. The clinical course of GPP is highly variable; it can be a relapsing disease with recurrent flares and no pustulation between flares or a persistent disease with perpetual mild pustulation punctuated with flares of greater severity. Patients may have multiple flares per year or a flare every few years. Most flares last 2‚Äì5 weeks and approximately 50\% require hospitalization. Life-threatening complications include sepsis and renal, hepatic, respiratory, and heart failure. Reported mortality rates are 2‚Äì16\%.},

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We aimed to evaluate the temporal trends in hospitalization and mortality from acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) and the associated financial costs over a 10-year period in Beijing, China.

Methods
Hospital admission records from 2008 to 2017 for all patients aged ‚â•20 years with a primary discharge diagnosis of AECOPD were retrieved from the Beijing Public Health Information Center Database. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze trends and calculate the annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC) for AECOPD hospitalization and mortality.

Results
A total of 337,802 AECOPD cases were recorded from 2008 to 2017. An inverse U-shaped trend in the AECOPD hospitalization rate was observed, showing an increase from 150.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2008 to 218.7 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2014 (APC: 5.5\%, 95\% CI: 2.9‚Äì8.2), before declining to 161.13 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017 (APC: ‚àí9.7\%, 95\% CI: ‚àí16.0 to-2.9). In-hospital mortality from AECOPD decreased significantly from 3.91\% to 2.21\% (AAPC: ‚àí11.4\%, 95\% CI: ‚àí15.5 to‚àí7.0). A decline in the median length of hospital stay from 13.0 days in 2008 to 12.0 days in 2017 (Ptrend {\textless} 0.001) was accompanied by a decrease in the use of mechanical ventilation from 2012 to 2017 (Ptrend {\textless} 0.001). However, the total hospitalization cost per case increased from 15953.5 yuan (USD \$2281.4) to 19874.5 yuan (\$2842.1) during the same period.

Conclusion
AECOPD remains a heavy burden¬†on the health care system in Beijing. Strategies to better manage COPD and reduce hospitalizations from AECOPD are needed.},

Publicly available software packages to compute biological aging measurements from DNA methylation data have accelerated dissemination of these measures and generated rapid gains in knowledge about how different measures perform in a range of datasets. Biological age measures derived from blood chemistry data were introduced at the same time as the DNA methylation measures and, in multiple studies, demonstrate superior performance to these measures in prediction of healthy lifespan. However, their dissemination has been slow by comparison, resulting in a significant gap in knowledge. We developed a software package to help address this knowledge gap. The BioAge R package, available for download at GitHub (http://github.com/dayoonkwon/BioAge), implements three published methods to quantify biological aging based on analysis of chronological age and mortality risk: Klemera-Doubal biological age, PhenoAge, and homeostatic dysregulation. The package allows users to parametrize measurement algorithms using custom sets of biomarkers, to compare the resulting measurements to published versions of the Klemera-Doubal method and PhenoAge algorithms, and to score the measurements in new datasets. We applied BioAge to safety lab data from the CALERIE‚Ñ¢ randomized controlled trial, the first-ever human trial of long-term calorie restriction in healthy, non-obese adults, to test effects of intervention on biological aging. Results contribute evidence that CALERIE intervention slowed biological aging. BioAge is a toolkit to facilitate measurement of biological age for geroscience.},

However, methods of quantifying biological aging have been little studied in geriatric populations. We analyzed three clinical-biomarker-algorithm methods to quantify biological aging. Klemera‚ÄìDoubal method Biological Age and homeostatic dysregulation algorithms were parameterized from analysis of U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) data (N = 36,207) based on published methods. Levine method Biological Age was adapted from published analysis of NHANES data. Algorithms were applied to biomarker data from the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (Duke-EPESE) cohort of older adults (N = 1,374, aged 71‚Äì102 years, 35\% male, 52\% African American). We tested associations of biological aging measures with participant reported Activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) dependencies, and mortality. We evaluated the sensitivity of results to the demographic composition of reference samples and biomarker sets used to develop biological aging algorithms. African American and white Duke-EPESE participants with more advanced biological aging reported dependence in more ADLs and IADLs and were at increased risk of death over follow-up through 2017. Effect sizes were similar across algorithms, but were strongest for Levine method Biological Age (per-quintile increase in ADL incidence rate ratio = 1.25, 95\% confidence interval [1.17‚Äì1.37], IADL incidence rate ratio = 1.23 [1.15‚Äì1.32], mortality hazard ratio = 1.12 [1.08‚Äì1.16]). Results were insensitive to demographic composition of reference samples, but modestly sensitive to the biomarker sets used to develop biological aging algorithms. Blood-chemistry-based quantifications of biological aging show promise for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to extend healthy life span in older adults.},

The underlying mechanisms of disease are still not fully understood, but research suggests that delaying the aging process could ameliorate these pathologies. A key biological process in aging is cellular senescence which is associated with several stressors such as telomere shortening or enhanced DNA methylation. Telomere length as well as DNA methylation levels can be used as biological age predictors which are able to detect excessive acceleration or deceleration of aging. Analytical methods examining aging are often not suitable, expensive, time-consuming or require a high level of technical expertise. Therefore, research focusses on combining analytical methods which have the potential to simultaneously analyse epigenetic, genomic as well as metabolic changes.},

	abstract = {Background Laboratory tests of blood and sometimes urine are used to diagnose and to monitor disease activity (DA) in SLE. Clinical practice would be simplified if non-invasive urine and salivary tests could be introduced as alternatives to blood samples. We therefore explored the levels of innate immunity-related biomarkers in matched serum, urine and saliva samples from patients with SLE.
Methods A total of 84 patients with SLE selected to represent high and low general DA, and 21 controls were included. All participants underwent a thorough clinical examination. General DA and renal DA were measured. The levels of colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1, interleukin (IL)-34, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Œ±, interferon-Œ≥-induced protein (IP)-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, calprotectin, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1Œ± and MIP-1Œ≤ were analysed by immunoassays and related to DA.
Results CSF-1, TNF-Œ±, IP-10 and MCP-1 in saliva, serum and urine, as well as calprotectin in saliva and urine were increased in patients with SLE as compared with controls (p{\textless}0.05). TNF-Œ±, IP-10 and MCP-1 in saliva, serum and urine, and CSF-1 in saliva and serum distinguished patients with SLE from controls (area under the curve {\textgreater}0.659; p{\textless}0.05 for all). CSF-1 in serum and urine, and calprotectin in saliva and urine, as well as TNF- Œ±, IP-10 and MCP-1 in urine correlated positively with measures of general DA (p{\textless}0.05). Patients with SLE with active renal disease presented elevated levels of TNF-Œ±, IP-10 and MCP-1 in urine and CSF-1 and IP-10 in serum as compared with patients with SLE with non-active renal disease.
Conclusions Our investigation demonstrates that saliva is a novel alternative body fluid, with potential for surveillance of general DA in patients with SLE, but urine is more informative in patients with SLE with predominantly renal DA.},

	abstract = {Non-invasive bio-samples, such as saliva and urine, are promising tools for assessment of inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers. Few studies have investigated potential responses of those biomarkers towards short-term PM2.5 exposure. We conducted a longitudinal study with 4 repeated examinations among 40 healthy, nonsmoking adults in Shanghai, China. Personal samplings were performed for PM2.5 exposure assessment. Then, five biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±), alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) in saliva and 8-Iso-Prostaglanding F2Œ± (8-iso-PGF2Œ±), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in urine, were measured. We fitted linear mixed-effect models to evaluate short-term effect of personal PM2.5 exposure on salivary and urinary biomarkers, adjusting for potential confounders of meteorology, sociodemographic characteristics and biomarker detection. We also explored sensitive time windows of exposure for different biomarkers. We found robust associations of salivary CRP, TNF-Œ±, and urinary 8-iso-PGF2Œ± with PM2.5 exposure, and responses of salivary inflammatory markers occurred more acutely than urinary oxidative stress markers. For instance, a 10¬†Œºg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with an elevation of 5.49\% (95\% CI: 1.17\%, 9.99\%) in CRP and 7.05\% (95\% CI: 1.29\%, 13.13\%) in TNF-Œ± both at lag 12¬†h, and 6.97\% (95\% CI: 1.33\%, 12.92\%) in 8-iso-PGF2Œ± at lag 01¬†d. Based on non-invasive samples, this study provided evidence on effect of PM2.5 exposure on responses of systematic inflammation and oxidative stress. Sub-daily (6‚Äì12¬†h) and daily (‚â•24¬†h) period after PM2.5 exposure might be sensitive time window to detect the responses of salivary (i.e. CRP, TNF) and urinary biomarkers (i.e. 8-iso-PGF2Œ±), respectively.},

	abstract = {Objective
This study aimed to identify sleep disturbance subtypes (‚Äúphenotypes‚Äù) among Latinx adults based on objective sleep data using a flexible unsupervised machine learning technique.
Methods
This study was an analysis of sleep data from three cross-sectional studies of the Precision in Symptom Self-Management Center at Columbia University. All studies focused on sleep health in Latinx adults at increased risk for sleep disturbance. Data on total sleep time (TST), time in bed (TIB), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep efficiency (SE), number of awakenings (NOA) and the mean length of nightly awakenings were collected using wrist-mounted accelerometers. Cluster analysis of the sleep data was conducted using an unsupervised machine learning approach that relies on mixtures of multivariate generalized linear mixed models.
Results
The analytic sample included 494 days of data from 118 adults (Ages 19‚Äì77). A 3-cluster model provided the best fit based on deviance indices (ie, DŒî‚àº¬†‚àí75 and¬†‚àí17 from 1- and 2- to 3-cluster models, respectively) and likelihood ratio (Pdiff¬†‚àº¬†0.93). Phenotype 1 (n¬†=¬†64) was associated with greater likelihood of overall adequate SE and less variability in SE and WASO. Phenotype 2 (n¬†=¬†11) was characterized by higher NOAs, and greater WASO and TIB than the other phenotypes. Phenotype 3 (n¬†=¬†43) was characterized by greater variability in SE, bed times and awakening times.
Conclusion
Robust digital data-driven modeling approaches can be useful for detecting sleep phenotypes from heterogenous patient populations, and have implications for designing precision sleep health strategies for management and early detection of sleep problems.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitous progress in wearable sensing and mobile computing technologies, alongside growing diversity in sensor modalities, has created new pathways for the collection of health and well-being data outside of laboratory settings, in a longitudinal fashion. Wearable and mobile devices have the potential to provide low-cost, objective measures of physical activity, clinically relevant data for patient assessment, and scalable behavior monitoring in large populations. These data can be used in both interventional and observational studies to derive insights regarding the links between behavior, health. and disease, as well as to advance the personalization and effectiveness of commercial wellness applications. Today, over 400,000 participants have had their behavior tracked prospectively using accelerometers for epidemiological studies across the globe. Traditionally, epidemiologists and clinicians have relied upon self-report measures of physical activity and sleep which, while valuable in the absence of alternatives, are subject to bias and often provide partial, incomplete information Physical behavior data extracted from wearable devices are being used to derive sensor-assessed, objective measures of physical behaviors, overcoming the limitations of self-report with the aim of relating these to clinical endpoints and eventually applying the findings to preventive and predictive medicine. Moreover, the application of artificial intelligence (AI), sensor fusion, and signal processing to wearable sensor data has led to improved human activity recognition and behavioral phenotyping. Here, we review the state of the art in wearable and mobile sensing technology in epidemiology and clinical medicine and discuss how AI is changing the field.},

For all three of these measures, the sepsis group had higher levels than the SIRS group (P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001), and the SIRS group had higher levels than the healthy control group. When combined, the three biomarkers had a sensitivity of 0.906 and a specificity of 0.896 in distinguishing sepsis from SIRS. Urinary C-reactive protein, urinary leucine-rich alpha glycoprotein-1 and urinary SAA have diagnostic value in cases of sepsis. This initial study suggests the possibility of improved differential diagnosis between sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome; additional confirmation is necessary to corroborate the findings.},

	abstract = {Background
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in pediatrics. Infection of the upper urinary tract may cause renal scarring, and subsequently renal failure and hypertension. Permanent renal damage has been suggested to be caused by the host inflammatory response. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the host defense mechanisms against such infection in order to make timely diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 as potential biomarkers in differentiating acute pyelonephritis (AP) from cystitis (Cys) in children.

Methods
Forty-three children (21 with AP and 22 with Cys) were included. Serum and urinary IL-6 and IL-8 were measured during the acute phase (within 12 hours of presentation) and the convalescent phase (8 weeks post-infection). Thirty-eight healthy children were included as controls.

Results
During the acute phase, the mean urinary IL-6 level in the Cys group was significantly higher than that in the controls (17.8 pg/mL vs 14.8 pg/mL, P=0.03), while the serum levels were significantly higher in both the Cys and AP groups than in the controls (19.5 pg/mL, 19.4 pg/mL, 15 pg/mL, P=0.005 and 0.02, respectively). During the convalescent phase, serum and urinary IL-6 levels were higher in patients than in controls. Urinary IL-8 levels were significantly higher in both the AP and Cys groups compared to controls (206.5 pg/mL, 291.8 pg/mL, 89.4 pg/mL, P=0.05 and 0.02, respectively) during the acute phase. Serum IL-8 was not significantly different between the 3 groups. Nonetheless, no significant differences were found between the AP and Cys groups, in urinary or serum levels of IL-6 or IL-8, during both phases.

Conclusion
IL-6 and IL-8 levels are elevated in patients with UTI. However, the levels did not differentiate between AP and cystitis. Further studies are warranted to evaluate their roles as indicators of the site of UTIs.},

	abstract = {Dark chocolate is claimed to have effects on gastrointestinal function and to improve well-being. This randomised controlled study tested the hypothesis that cocoa slows gastric emptying and intestinal transit. Functional brain imaging identified central effects of cocoa on cortical activity. Healthy volunteers (HV) ingested 100 g dark (72 \% cocoa) or white (0 \% cocoa) chocolate for 5 d, in randomised order. Participants recorded abdominal symptoms and stool consistency by the Bristol Stool Score (BSS). Gastric emptying (GE) and intestinal and colonic transit time were assessed by scintigraphy and marker studies, respectively. Combined positron emission tomography‚Äìcomputed tomography (PET‚ÄìCT) imaging assessed regional brain activity. A total of sixteen HV (seven females and nine males) completed the studies (mean age 34 (21‚Äì58) years, BMI 22¬∑8 (18¬∑5‚Äì26¬∑0) kg/m2). Dark chocolate had no effect on upper gastrointestinal function (GE half-time 82 (75‚Äì120) v. 83 (60‚Äì120) min; P=0¬∑937); however, stool consistency was increased (BSS 3 (3‚Äì5) v. 4 (4‚Äì6); P=0¬∑011) and there was a trend to slower colonic transit (17 (13‚Äì26) v. 21 (15‚Äì47) h; P=0¬∑075). PET‚ÄìCT imaging showed increased [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the visual cortex, with increased FDG uptake also in somatosensory, motor and pre-frontal cortices (P{\textless}0¬∑001). In conclusion, dark chocolate with a high cocoa content has effects on colonic and cerebral function in HV. Future research will assess its effects in patients with functional gastrointestinal diseases with disturbed bowel function and psychological complaints.},

Recent evidence indicates that the expression of receptors and vitamin D-modulated genes in young subjects has a seasonal profile. Therefore, we investigated the role of vitamin D on physical fitness across seasons in a total of 977 male adolescents. Anthropometrics, lifestyle, dietary habits, biochemical profiles and physical fitness were studied. Multiple linear regression models, including pairwise interaction terms involving total 25-OH-vitamin D, were fitted. The interacting effect of season and total 25-OH-vitamin D had a significant influence on physical fitness performance (spring and total 25-OH-vitamin D: √ü 0.19, SE 0.07, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.007; summer and total 25-OH-vitamin D: √ü 0.10, SE 0.06, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.11; autumn and total 25-OH-vitamin D: √ü 0.18, SE 0.07, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01), whereas the main effect of total 25-OH-vitamin D alone was not significant (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.30). Body fat percentage, recreational physical activity level, time spent per day gaming/TV-watching, smoking, and hemoglobin levels were also related to the physical fitness performance score. Future studies should further explore the role of seasonal-dependent effects of vitamin D on health.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: The body mass index (BMI) is an established anthropometric index for the development of obesity-related conditions. However, little is known about the distribution of BMI within a population, especially about this distribution‚Äôs temporal change. Here, we analysed changes in the distribution of height, weight and BMI over the past 140 years based on data of Swiss conscripts and tested for correlations between anthropometric data and standard blood parameters.
Methods: Height and weight were measured in 59 504 young Swiss males aged 18‚Äì19 years during conscription in 1875‚Äì79, 1932‚Äì36, 1994 and 2010‚Äì12. For 65\% of conscripts in 2010‚Äì12, results of standard blood analysis were available. We calculated descriptive statistics of the distribution of height, weight and BMI over the four time periods and tested for associations between BMI and metabolic parameters.
Results: Average and median body height, body weight and BMI increased over time. Height did no longer increase between 1994 and 2010‚Äì12, while weight and BMI still increased over these two decades. Variability ranges of weight and BMI increased over time, while variation of body height remained constant. Elevated levels of metabolic and inflammatory blood parameters were found at both ends of BMI distribution.
Conclusions and implications: Both overweight and underweight subgroups showed similar changes in inflammation parameters, pointing toward related metabolic deficiencies in both conditions. In addition to environmental influences, our results indicate a potential role of relaxed natural selection on genes affecting metabolism and body composition.},

Underlying etiologies are enigmatic and metabolic causes have been suggested to various extents before. We analyze links of major blood parameters to individual body mass in a young male cohort, controlling for socio-cultural factors, in order to explore an underlying metabolic cause of obesity. Anthropometric (height, weight) physiologic (blood pressure) and metabolic data (total cholesterol, alanine transaminase, creatinine, postprandial glucose, blood cell counts, haemoglobin) of Swiss conscripts (N = 46,684; 18 - 20 yrs old; 2005-2007 census) were examined in the context of their socio-cultural groupings (occupation, mother tongue, religion) by ANOVA and stepwise multiple regression analysis. Swiss Armed Forces recruiting is mandatory, thus each year‚Äôs group studied reflects more than 80\% of a year‚Äôs male Swiss citizen birth cohort. Individual body mass index ranged from 19 kg/m2 (5th percentile) to 29 kg/m2 (95th percentile) with a median of 22 kg/m2. BMI increases significantly, even within its normal range (18.5 - 25 kg/m2) with increases in alanine transaminase (r2 = 0.10), total cholesterol (r2 = 0.08) and erythrocyte counts (r2 = 0.02). All other parameters, including socio-cultural categories, explain individually 1\% or less of total BMI variation. Glucose values do not correlate with BMI significantly, thus suggesting a specific metabolic co-etiology of individual mass increases. There may occur a biochemical anomaly in liver metabolism that underlies development of the metabolic syndrome later in life. Were it so, pharmacological intervention rather than just diet and exercise regime could be more effective treatment of obesity.},

	abstract = {Blood coagulation activation might be one mechanism linking acute mental stress with coronary events. We investigated the natural habituation of coagulation responses and recovery to short-term mental stress.Three times with one-week intervals, 24 men (mean age 47 ¬± 7 years) underwent the same 13-min stressor (preparation, job interview, mental arithmetic). During each visit venous blood was obtained four times (baseline, immediately post-stress, 45 min of recovery, 105 min of recovery). Eight blood coagulation parameters were measured at weeks one and three. Acute stress provoked increases in von Willebrand factor antigen, fibrinogen, clotting factor FVII activity (FVII:C), FVIII:C, FXII:C (p‚Äôs ‚â§0.019), and D-dimer (N.S.). All coagulation parameters experienced full recovery except FVIII:C (p = 0.022). Stress did not significantly affect activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time. At all time points FVIII:C and FXII:C levels were significantly higher at week one compared to week three (p‚Äôs ‚â§0.041). Before catheter insertion, systolic blood pressure (p = 0.001) and heart rate (p = 0.026) were relatively higher at week one. Unlike the magnitude of systolic blood pressure response to stress (p = 0.007) and of cortisol recovery from stress (p = 0.002), the magnitude of all coagulation responses to stress and the recovery from stress were similar in week one and week three. Sympathetic activation with anticipatory stress best explained increased baseline activity in FVIII and FXII at week one. An incapacity of the coagulation system to adapt to stress repeats is perhaps a consequence of evolution, but might also contribute to increased coronary risk in some individuals, particularly in those with cardiovascular diseases.},

	abstract = {Background The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends ongoing surveillance of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their risk factors, using the WHO STEPwise approach to surveillance (STEPS). The aim of this study was to assess the distribution and determinants of NCD risk factors in Nepal, a low-income country, in which two-thirds (66\%) of annual deaths are attributable to NCDs. Methods A nationally representative NCD risk factors STEPS survey (instrument version 3.2), was conducted between February and May 2019, among 6,475 eligible participants of age 15‚Äì69 years sampled from all 7 provinces through multistage sampling process. Data collection involved assessment of behavioral and biochemical risk factors. Complex survey analysis was completed in STATA 15, along with Poisson regression modelling to examine associations between covariates and risk factor prevalence. Results The most prevalent risk factor was consumption of less than five servings of fruit and vegetables a day (97\%; 95\% CI: 94.3‚Äì98.0). Out of total participants, 17\% (95\% CI: 15.1‚Äì19.1) were current smoker, 6.8\% (95\% CI: 5.3‚Äì8.2) were consuming ‚â•60g/month alcohol per month and 7.4\% (95\% CI:5.7‚Äì10.1) were having low level of physical activity. Approximately, 24.3\% (95\% CI: 21.6‚Äì27.2) were overweight or obese (BMI‚â•25kg/m2) while 24.5\% (95\% CI: 22.4‚Äì26.7) and 5.8\% (95\% CI: 4.3‚Äì7.3) had raised blood pressure (BP) and raised blood glucose respectively. Similarly, the prevalence of raised total cholesterol was 11\% (95\% CI: 9.6‚Äì12.6). Sex and education level of participants were statistically associated with smoking, harmful alcohol use and raised BP. Participants of age 30‚Äì44 years and 45‚Äì69 years were found to have increased risk of overweight, raised BP, raised blood sugar and raised blood cholesterol. Similarly, participants in richest wealth quintile had higher odds of insufficient physical inactivity, overweight and raised blood cholesterol. On average, each participant had 2 NCD related risk factors (2.04, 95\% CI: 2.02‚Äì2.08). Conclusion A large portion of the Nepalese population are living with a variety of NCD risk factors. These surveillance data should be used to support and monitor province specific NCD prevention and control interventions throughout Nepal, supported by a multi-sectoral national coordination mechanism.},

            Smartphones are now nearly ubiquitous; their numerous built-in sensors enable continuous measurement of activities of daily living, making them especially well-suited for health research. Researchers have proposed various human activity recognition (HAR) systems aimed at translating measurements from smartphones into various types of physical activity. In this review, we summarized the existing approaches to smartphone-based HAR. For this purpose, we systematically searched Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles published up to December 2020 on the use of smartphones for HAR. We extracted information on smartphone body location, sensors, and physical activity types studied and the data transformation techniques and classification schemes used for activity recognition. Consequently, we identified 108 articles and described the various approaches used for data acquisition, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and activity classification, identifying the most common practices, and their alternatives. We conclude that smartphones are well-suited for HAR research in the health sciences. For population-level impact, future studies should focus on improving the quality of collected data, address missing data, incorporate more diverse participants and activities, relax requirements about phone placement, provide more complete documentation on study participants, and share the source code of the implemented methods and algorithms.},

            Background
            
              An individual‚Äôs biological age is a measurement of health status and provides a mechanistic understanding of aging.
              Age clocks
              estimate a biological age of an individual based on their various
              features
              . Existing clocks have key limitations caused by the undesirable tradeoff between accuracy (i.e., predictive performance for chronological age or mortality, often achieved by complex, black-box models) and interpretability (i.e., the contributions of features to biological age). Here, we present ‚ÄòENABL (
              E

              ogical) Age‚Äô, a computational framework that combines machine learning (ML) models with explainable AI (XAI) methods to accurately estimate biological age with individualized explanations.
            
          
          
            Methods
            To construct ENABL Age clock, we first need to predict an age-related outcome of interest (e.g., all-cause or cause-specific mortality), and then rescale the predictions nonlinearly to estimate biological age. We trained and evaluated the ENABL Age clock using the UK Biobank (501,366 samples with 825 features) and NHANES 1999-2014 (47,084 samples with 158 features) datasets. To explain the ENABL Age clock, we extended existing XAI methods so we could linearly decompose any individual‚Äôs ENABL Age into contributing risk factors. To make ENABL Age clock broadly accessible, we developed two versions: (1) ENABL Age-L, which is based on popular blood tests, and (2) ENABL Age-Q, which is based on questionnaire features. Finally, when we created ENABL Age clocks based on predictions of different age-related outcomes, we validated that each one captures sensible, yet disparate aging mechanisms by performing GWAS association analyses.
          
          
            Findings
            Our results indicate that ENABL Age clocks successfully separate healthy from unhealthy aging individuals and are stronger predictors of mortality than existing age clocks. We externally validated our results by training ENABL Age clocks on UK Biobank data and testing on NHANES data. The individualized explanations that reveal the contribution of specific features to ENABL Age provide insights into the important features for biological age. Association analysis with risk factors and agingrelated morbidities, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) results on ENABL Age clocks trained on different mortality causes show that each one captures sensible aging mechanisms.
          
          
            Interpretation
            We developed and validated a new ML and XAI-based approach to calculate and interpret biological age based on multiple aging mechanisms. Our results show strong mortality prediction power, interpretability, and flexibility. ENABL Age takes a consequential step towards accurate interpretable biological age prediction built with complex, high-performance ML models.
          
          
            Research in context
          
          
            Evidence before this study
            Biological age plays an important role to understanding the mechanisms underlying aging. We search PubMed for original articles published in all languages with the terms ‚Äúbiological age‚Äù published until June 22, 2022. Most prior studies focus on the first generation of biological age clocks that are designed to predict chronological age. These clocks have weak and variable associations with mortality risk and other aging outcomes. Only a few studies present the second-generation of biological age clocks, which are built directly with aging outcomes. However, these studies use linear models and do not provide individualized explanations. Moreover, previous biological age clocks cannot specify what aging process they capture. Unlike our study, none of the previous studies have combined a complex machine learning (ML) model and an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method, which allows us to build biological ages that are both accurate and interpretable.
          
          
            Added value of this study
            In this study, we present ENABL Age, a new approach to estimate and understand biological age that combines complex ML models and XAI method. The ENABL Age approach is designed to measure secondgeneration biological age clocks by directly predicting age-related outcomes. Our results indicate that ENABL Age accurately reflects individual health status. We also introduce two variants of ENABL Age clocks: (1) ENABL Age-L, which takes popular blood tests as inputs (usable by medical professionals), and (2) ENABL Age-Q, which takes questionnaire features as inputs (usable by non-professional healthcare consumers). We extend existing XAI methods to calculate the contributions of input features to ENABL Age estimate in units of years, which makes our biological age clocks more human-interpretable. Our association analysis and GWAS results show that ENABL Age clocks trained on different age-related outcomes can capture different aging mechanisms.
          
          
            Implications of all the available evidence
            We develop and validate a new ML and XAI-based approach to measure and interpret biological age based on multiple aging mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that ENABL age has strong mortality prediction power, is interpretable, and is flexible. ENABL Age takes a consequential step towards applying XAI to interpret biological age models. Its flexibility allows for many future extensions to omics data, even multi-omic data, and multi-task learning.},

            Sleep is associated with various health outcomes.

Here we analyzed sleep tracking data, along with questionnaire responses and multi-modal phenotypic data generated from 482 normal volunteers. First, we compared wearable-derived and self-reported sleep metrics, particularly total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE). We then identified demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors associated with wearable-derived TST; they included age, gender, occupation and alcohol consumption. Multi-modal phenotypic data analysis showed that wearable-derived TST and SE were associated with cardiovascular disease risk markers such as body mass index and waist circumference, whereas self-reported measures were not. Using wearable-derived TST, we showed that insufficient sleep was associated with premature telomere attrition. Our study highlights the potential for sleep metrics from consumer wearables to provide novel insights into data generated from population cohort studies.},

              To examine whether rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters can predict all-cause, cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality in a general adult population of the US. We further compared the mortality predictive performance of these parameters with that of traditional risk factors. This study included 7,252 adults from US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 2011‚Äì2014, who had wrist accelerometer data obtained at baseline and follow-up status linked to the National Death Index records (2011‚Äì2019). During a median of 81¬†months (interquartile range, 69‚Äì94¬†months) of follow-up, 674 (9.3\%) deaths occurred. There were inverse associations between relative amplitude (RA) and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality with increased quartiles RA associated with lower mortality risk (all
              P
              ‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.05). The Hazard Ratios ranged from 0.61 to 0.79. Furthermore, RA outperformed all the tested traditional predictors of all-cause mortality with the exception of age. This study suggests that participants with blunted rest-activity circadian rhythms had a higher risk of all-cause, cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality. Future studies will be needed to test whether interventions that regulate rest-activity circadian activity rhythms will improve health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Digitalization of healthcare delivery is rapidly fostering development of precision medicine. Multiple digital technologies, known as telehealth or eHealth tools, are guiding individualized diagnosis and treatment for patients, and can contribute significantly to the objectives of precision medicine. From a basis of ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù healthcare, precision medicine provides a paradigm shift to deliver a more nuanced and personalized approach. Genomic medicine utilizing new technologies can provide precision analysis of causative mutations, with personalized understanding of mechanisms and effective therapy. Education is fundamental to the telehealth process, with artificial intelligence (AI) enhancing learning for healthcare professionals and empowering patients to contribute to their care. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region is rapidly implementing telehealth strategies at all levels and a workshop was convened to discuss aspirations of precision medicine in the context of pediatric endocrinology, including diabetes and growth disorders, with this paper based on those discussions. GCC regional investment in AI, bioinformatics and genomic medicine, is rapidly providing healthcare benefits. However, embracing precision medicine is presenting some major new design, installation and skills challenges. Genomic medicine is enabling precision and personalization of diagnosis and therapy of endocrine conditions. Digital education and communication tools in the field of endocrinology include chatbots, interactive robots and augmented reality. Obesity and diabetes are a major challenge in the GCC region and eHealth tools are increasingly being used for management of care. With regard to growth failure, digital technologies for growth hormone (GH) administration are being shown to enhance adherence and response outcomes. While technical innovations become more affordable with increasing adoption, we should be aware of sustainability, design and implementation costs, training of HCPs and prediction of overall healthcare benefits, which are essential for precision medicine to develop and for its objectives to be achieved.},

	abstract = {Digitalization of healthcare delivery is rapidly fostering development of precision medicine. Multiple digital technologies, known as telehealth or eHealth tools, are guiding individualized diagnosis and treatment for patients, and can contribute significantly to the objectives of precision medicine. From a basis of ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù healthcare, precision medicine provides a paradigm shift to deliver a more nuanced and personalized approach. Genomic medicine utilizing new technologies can provide precision analysis of causative mutations, with personalized understanding of mechanisms and effective therapy. Education is fundamental to the telehealth process, with artificial intelligence (AI) enhancing learning for healthcare professionals and empowering patients to contribute to their care. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region is rapidly implementing telehealth strategies at all levels and a workshop was convened to discuss aspirations of precision medicine in the context of pediatric endocrinology, including diabetes and growth disorders, with this paper based on those discussions. GCC regional investment in AI, bioinformatics and genomic medicine, is rapidly providing healthcare benefits. However, embracing precision medicine is presenting some major new design, installation and skills challenges. Genomic medicine is enabling precision and personalization of diagnosis and therapy of endocrine conditions. Digital education and communication tools in the field of endocrinology include chatbots, interactive robots and augmented reality. Obesity and diabetes are a major challenge in the GCC region and eHealth tools are increasingly being used for management of care. With regard to growth failure, digital technologies for growth hormone (GH) administration are being shown to enhance adherence and response outcomes. While technical innovations become more affordable with increasing adoption, we should be aware of sustainability, design and implementation costs, training of HCPs and prediction of overall healthcare benefits, which are essential for precision medicine to develop and for its objectives to be achieved.},

              Background
              Population segmentation is useful for understanding the health needs of populations. Expert-driven segmentation is a traditional approach which involves subjective decisions on how to segment data, with no agreed best practice. The limitations of this approach are theoretically overcome by more data-driven approaches such as utilisation-based cluster analysis. Previous explorations of using utilisation-based cluster analysis for segmentation have demonstrated feasibility but were limited in potential usefulness for local service planning. This study explores the potential for practical application of using utilisation-based cluster analyses to segment a local General Practice-registered population in the South Wales Valleys.
            
            
              Methods
              Primary and secondary care datasets were linked to create a database of 79,607 patients including socio-demographic variables, morbidities, care utilisation, cost and risk factor information. We undertook utilisation-based cluster analysis, using k-means methodology to group the population into segments with distinct healthcare utilisation patterns based on seven utilisation variables: elective inpatient admissions, non-elective inpatient admissions, outpatient first \& follow-up attendances, Emergency Department visits, GP practice visits and prescriptions. We analysed segments post-hoc to understand their morbidity, risk and demographic profiles.
            
            
              Results
              Ten population segments were identified which had distinct profiles of healthcare use, morbidity, demographic characteristics and risk attributes. Although half of the study population were in segments characterised as ‚Äòlow need‚Äô populations, there was heterogeneity in this group with respect to variables relevant to service planning ‚Äì e.g. settings in which care was mostly consumed. Significant and complex healthcare need was a feature across age groups and was driven more by deprivation and behavioural risk factors than by age and functional limitation.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This analysis shows that utilisation-based cluster analysis of linked primary and secondary healthcare use data for a local GP-registered population can segment the population into distinct groups with unique health and care needs, providing useful intelligence to inform local population health service planning and care delivery. This segmentation approach can offer a detailed understanding of the health and care priorities of population groups, potentially supporting the integration of health and care, reducing fragmentation of healthcare and reducing healthcare costs in the population.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The ambition of precision medicine is to design and optimize the pathway for diagnosis, therapeutic intervention, and prognosis by using large multidimensional biological datasets that capture individual variability in genes, function and environment. This offers clinicians the opportunity to more carefully tailor early interventions‚Äî whether treatment or preventative in nature‚Äîto each individual patient. Taking advantage of high performance computer capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can now achieve reasonable success in predicting risk in certain cancers and cardiovascular disease from available multidimensional clinical and biological data. In contrast, less progress has been made with the neurodevelopmental disorders, which include intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy and broader neurodevelopmental disorders. Much hope is pinned on the opportunity to quantify risk from patterns of genomic variation, including the functional characterization of genes and variants, but this ambition is confounded by phenotypic and etiologic heterogeneity, along with the rare and variable penetrant nature of the underlying risk variants identified so far. Structural and functional brain imaging and neuropsychological and neurophysiological markers may provide further dimensionality, but often require more development to achieve sensitivity for diagnosis. Herein, therefore, lies a precision medicine conundrum: can artificial intelligence offer a breakthrough in predicting risks and prognosis for neurodevelopmental disorders? In this review we will examine these complexities, and consider some of the strategies whereby artificial intelligence may overcome them.},

We found that accelerated biological aging from our ‚ÄúMoveAge‚Äù predictor is associated with higher all-cause mortality. We further searched for nutritional or pharmacological compounds that associate with decelerated aging according to our model. A number of nutritional components peak in their association to decelerated aging later in life, including fiber, magnesium, and vitamin E. We additionally identified one FDA-approved drug associated with decelerated biological aging: the alpha-blocker doxazosin. We show that doxazosin extends healthspan and lifespan in C. elegans. Our work demonstrates how a biological aging score based on relative mobility can be accessible to the wider public and can potentially be used to identify and determine efficacy of geroprotective interventions.},

            Impaired rest‚Äìactivity circadian rhythm has been associated with increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Animals with mutations in clock genes display accelerated aging and shortened life span. Whether impaired rest‚Äìactivity circadian rhythm is also associated with processes of aging in humans has not been explored. We analyzed accelerometry and physiological data from 7 539 adults participating in the 2011‚Äì2014 waves of the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. We used accelerometry data to compute rest‚Äìactivity rhythm measurements. We used physiological data to compute measurements of biological aging according to 3 published algorithms: Klemera‚ÄìDoubal method (KDM) Biological Age, PhenoAge, and homeostatic dysregulation (HD). In the models adjusting multiple covariates, participants with higher relative amplitude (RA) and interdaily stability (IS) and lower intradaily variability (IV) exhibited less advanced biological aging indexed by KDM and PhenoAge (effect sizes for 1-quantile increase in these rest‚Äìactivity measurements ranged from 0.54 to 0.57 ‚Äúyears‚Äù for RA, 0.24 to 0.28 ‚Äúyears‚Äù for IS, and 0.24 to 0.35 ‚Äúyears‚Äù for IV, ps \&lt; .001). Similar finding was observed for biological aging indexed by HD, but the significance was limited to RA with 1-quantile increase in RA associated with 0.09 log units decrease in HD (p \&lt; .001). The results indicate that blunted rest‚Äìactivity circadian rhythm is associated with accelerated aging in the general population, suggesting that interventions aiming at enhancing circadian rhythm may be a novel approach for the extension of a healthy life span.},

We examined whether sleep duration is associated with incidence of a first chronic disease, subsequent multimorbidity and mortality using data spanning 25 years. Methods and findings Data were drawn from the prospective Whitehall II cohort study, established in 1985 on 10,308 persons employed in the London offices of the British civil service. Self-reported sleep duration was measured 6 times between 1985 and 2016, and data on sleep duration was extracted at age 50 (mean age (standard deviation) = 50.6 (2.6)), 60 (60.3 (2.2)), and 70 (69.2 (1.9)). Incidence of multimorbidity was defined as having 2 or more of 13 chronic diseases, follow-up up to March 2019. Cox regression, separate analyses at each age, was used to examine associations of sleep duration at age 50, 60, and 70 with incident multimorbidity. Multistate models were used to examine the association of sleep duration at age 50 with onset of a first chronic disease, progression to incident multimorbidity, and death. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, and health-related factors. A total of 7,864 (32.5\% women) participants free of multimorbidity had data on sleep duration at age 50; 544 (6.9\%) reported sleeping ‚â§5 hours, 2,562 (32.6\%) 6 hours, 3,589 (45.6\%) 7 hours, 1,092 (13.9\%) 8 hours, and 77 (1.0\%) ‚â•9 hours. Compared to 7-hour sleep, sleep duration ‚â§5 hours was associated with higher multimorbidity risk (hazard ratio: 1.30, 95\% confidence interval = 1.12 to 1.50; p {\textless} 0.001). This was also the case for short sleep duration at age 60 (1.32, 1.13 to 1.55; p {\textless} 0.001) and 70 (1.40, 1.16 to 1.68; p {\textless} 0.001). Sleep duration ‚â•9 hours at age 60 (1.54, 1.15 to 2.06; p = 0.003) and 70 (1.51, 1.10 to 2.08; p = 0.01) but not 50 (1.39, 0.98 to 1.96; p = 0.07) was associated with incident multimorbidity. Among 7,217 participants free of chronic disease at age 50 (mean follow-up = 25.2 years), 4,446 developed a first chronic disease, 2,297 progressed to multimorbidity, and 787 subsequently died. Compared to 7-hour sleep, sleeping ‚â§5 hours at age 50 was associated with an increased risk of a first chronic disease (1.20, 1.06 to 1.35; p = 0.003) and, among those who developed a first disease, with subsequent multimorbidity (1.21, 1.03 to 1.42; p = 0.02). Sleep duration ‚â•9 hours was not associated with these transitions. No association was found between sleep duration and mortality among those with existing chronic diseases. The study limitations include the small number of cases in the long sleep category, not allowing conclusions to be drawn for this category, the self-reported nature of sleep data, the potential for reverse causality that could arise from undiagnosed conditions at sleep measures, and the small proportion of non-white participants, limiting generalization of findings. Conclusions In this study, we observed short sleep duration to be associated with risk of chronic disease and subsequent multimorbidity but not with progression to death. There was no robust evidence of an increased risk of chronic disease among those with long sleep duration at age 50. Our findings suggest an association between short sleep duration and multimorbidity.},

The clock endows the host with temporal precision and robust adaptation to the surrounding environment. When circadian rhythms are perturbed or misaligned, as a result of jet lag, shiftwork or other lifestyle factors, adverse health consequences arise, and the risks of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases or metabolic disorders increase. Although the negative impact of circadian rhythm disruption is now well established, it remains underappreciated how to take advantage of biological timing, or correct it, for health benefits. In this Review, we provide an updated account of the circadian system and highlight several key disease areas with altered circadian signalling. We discuss environmental and lifestyle modifications of circadian rhythm and clock-based therapeutic strategies, including chronotherapy, in which dosing time is deliberately optimized for maximum therapeutic index, and pharmacological agents that target core clock components and proximal regulators. Promising progress in research, disease models and clinical applications should encourage a concerted effort towards a new era of circadian medicine.},

	abstract = {In this paper we extend the "network theory of aging," and we argue that a global reduction in the capacity to cope with a variety of stressors and a concomitant progressive increase in proinflammatory status are major characteristics of the aging process. This phenomenon, which we will refer to as "inflamm-aging," is provoked by a continuous antigenic load and stress. On the basis of evolutionary studies, we also argue that the immune and the stress responses are equivalent and that antigens are nothing other than particular types of stressors. We also propose to return macrophage to its rightful place as central actor not only in the inflammatory response and immunity, but also in the stress response. The rate of reaching the threshold of proinflammatory status over which diseases/disabilities ensue and the individual capacity to cope with and adapt to stressors are assumed to be complex traits with a genetic component. Finally, we argue that the persistence of inflammatory stimuli over time represents the biologic background (first hit) favoring the susceptibility to age-related diseases/disabilities. A second hit (absence of robust gene variants and/or presence of frail gene variants) is likely necessary to develop overt organ-specific age-related diseases having an inflammatory pathogenesis, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Following this perspective, several paradoxes of healthy centenarians (increase of plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins, and coagulation factors) are illustrated and explained. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of inflammation devoted to the neutralization of dangerous/harmful agents early in life and in adulthood become detrimental late in life in a period largely not foreseen by evolution, according to the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging.},

To test such "geroprotective" therapies in humans, outcome measures are needed that can assess extension of disease-free life span. This need has spurred development of different methods to quantify biological aging. But different methods have not been systematically compared in the same humans. We implemented 7 methods to quantify biological aging using repeated-measures physiological and genomic data in 964 middle-aged humans in the Dunedin Study (New Zealand; persons born 1972-1973). We studied 11 measures in total: telomere-length and erosion, 3 epigenetic-clocks and their ticking rates, and 3 biomarker-composites. Contrary to expectation, we found low agreement between different measures of biological aging. We next compared associations between biological aging measures and outcomes that geroprotective therapies seek to modify: physical functioning, cognitive decline, and subjective signs of aging, including aged facial appearance. The 71-cytosine-phosphate-guanine epigenetic clock and biomarker composites were consistently related to these aging-related outcomes. However, effect sizes were modest. Results suggested that various proposed approaches to quantifying biological aging may not measure the same aspects of the aging process. Further systematic evaluation and refinement of measures of biological aging is needed to furnish outcomes for geroprotector trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We tested the association of biologic age (BA) measures constructed from different types of biomarkers with mortality and disease in a community-based sample.
METHODS: In Framingham Offspring participants at Exams 7 (1998-2001, mean age 62 ¬± 10) and 8 (2005-2008, mean age 67 ¬± 9), we used the Klemera-Doubal method to estimate clinical BA and inflammatory BA and computed the difference (‚àÜage) between BA and CA. Clinical ‚àÜage was computed at Exam 2 (1979-1983, mean age 45 ¬± 10). At Exam 8, we computed measures of intrinsic and extrinsic epigenetic age. Participants were followed through 2014 for outcomes. Cox proportional hazards models tested the association of each BA estimate with each outcome adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: Sample sizes ranged from 2532 to 3417 participants. In multivariable models, each 1-year increase in clinical ‚àÜage at Exam 2 (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04-1.06, p {\textless} 2 √ó 10-16) and clinical ‚àÜage and inflammatory ‚àÜage at Exam 7 significantly increased the hazards of mortality and incident cardiovascular disease (HR = 1.01-1.05, p {\textless} 2 √ó 10-7), whereas inflammatory ‚àÜage increased the hazards of cancer (HR = 1.01, p {\textless} .05). At Exam 8, increased clinical ‚àÜage, inflammatory ‚àÜage, and extrinsic epigenetic age all significantly increased the hazard of mortality (HR = 1.03-1.05, all p {\textless} .05); clinical ‚àÜage and inflammatory ‚àÜage increased cardiovascular disease risk (HR = 1.04-1.05, all p {\textless} .01); and clinical ‚àÜage increased cancer risk (HR = 1.03, p {\textless} .01) when all three BA measures were included in the model. Intrinsic epigenetic age was not significantly associated with any outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest BA measures may be complementary in predicting risk for mortality and age-related disease.},

	abstract = {Background: Physical behavior researchers using motion sensors often use acceleration summaries to visualize, clean, and interpret data. Such output is dependent on device specifications (e.g., dynamic range, sampling rate) and/or are proprietary, which invalidate cross-study comparison of findings when using different devices. This limits flexibility in selecting devices to measure physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep. Purpose: Develop an open-source, universal acceleration summary metric that accounts for discrepancies in raw data among research and consumer devices. Methods: We used signal processing techniques to generate a Monitor-Independent Movement Summary unit (MIMS-unit) optimized to capture normal human motion. Methodological steps included raw signal harmonization to eliminate inter-device variability (e.g., dynamic g-range, sampling rate), bandpass filtering (0.2‚Äì5.0 Hz) to eliminate non-human movement, and signal aggregation to reduce data to simplify visualization and summarization. We examined the consistency of MIMS-units using orbital shaker testing on eight accelerometers with varying dynamic range (¬±2 to ¬±8 g) and sampling rates (20‚Äì100 Hz), and human data (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ60) from an ActiGraph GT9X. Results: During shaker testing, MIMS-units yielded lower between-device coefficient of variations than proprietary ActiGraph and ENMO acceleration summaries. Unlike the widely used ActiGraph activity counts, MIMS-units were sensitive in detecting subtle wrist movements during sedentary behaviors. Conclusions: Open-source MIMS-units may provide a means to summarize high-resolution raw data in a device-independent manner, thereby increasing standardization of data cleaning and analytical procedures to estimate selected attributes of physical behavior across studies.},

For this reason, we studied the collection of all the Hippocratic texts, called the Corpus Hippocraticum, using original translations, and attempted an interpretation of the ancient authors in the context of the modern concept of PM. The most important points located in the ancient passages were: (1) medicine in not 'absolute', thus its directions cannot be generalized to everybody, (2) each human body/organism is different and responds differently to therapy; therefore, the same treatment cannot be suitable for everybody and (3) the physician should choose the appropriate treatment, depending on the patients' individual characteristics, such as different health status and life style (activities, diet, etc.). Although the ancient 'precision medicine' is different from its modern description, the latter derived from well-established experimental conclusions, it becomes apparent that there is a common conception, aiming to achieve more effective healing by focusing on the individual.},

A variety of behavioral, physiological and hormonal responses vary in amplitude over a 24-hour period and the degree to which these circadian rhythms are synchronized to the daily light-dark cycle can be quantified with a technique known as phasor analysis. Several studies have been carried out using phasor analysis in an attempt to measure circadian disruption exhibited by animals and by humans. To perform these studies, species-specific light measurement and light delivery technologies had to be developed based upon a fundamental understanding of circadian phototransduction mechanisms in the different species. When both nocturnal rodents and diurnal humans experienced different species-specific light-dark shift schedules, they showed, based upon phasor analysis of the light-dark and activity-rest patterns, similar levels of light-dependent circadian disruption. Indeed, both rodents and humans show monotonically increasing and quantitatively similar levels of light-dependent circadian disruption with increasing shift-nights per week. Thus, phasor analysis provides a method for quantifying circadian disruption in the field and in the laboratory as well as a bridge between ecological measurements of circadian entrainment in humans and parametric studies of circadian disruption in animal models, including nocturnal rodents.},

	abstract = {Chronic diseases (i.e., noncommunicable diseases), mainly cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory diseases and type-2-diabetes, are now the leading cause of death, disability and diminished quality of life on the planet. Moreover, these diseases are also a major financial burden worldwide, significantly impacting the economy of many countries. Healthcare systems and medicine have progressively improved upon the ability to address infectious diseases and react to adverse health events through both surgical interventions and pharmacology; we have become efficient in delivering reactive care (i.e., initiating interventions once an individual is on the verge of or has actually suffered a negative health event). However, with slowly progressing and often ‚Äòsilent‚Äô chronic diseases now being the main cause of illness, healthcare and medicine must evolve into a proactive system, moving away from a merely reactive approach to care. Minimal interactions among the specialists and limited information to the general practitioner and to the individual receiving care lead to a fragmented health approach, non-concerted prescriptions, a scattered follow-up and a suboptimal cost-effectiveness ratio. A new approach in medicine that is predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory, which we label here as ‚ÄúP4‚Äù holds great promise to reduce the burden of chronic diseases by harnessing technology and an increasingly better understanding of environment-biology interactions, evidence-based interventions and the underlying mechanisms of chronic diseases. In this concept paper, we propose a ‚ÄòP4 Health Continuum‚Äô model as a framework to promote and facilitate multi-stakeholder collaboration with an orchestrated common language and an integrated care model to increase the healthspan.},

	abstract = {The emerging concept of systems medicine (or ‚ÄòP4 medicine‚Äô‚Äîpredictive, preventive, personalized and participatory) is at the vanguard of the post-genomic movement towards ‚Äòprecision medicine‚Äô. It is the medical application of systems biology, the biological study of wholes. Of particular interest, P4 systems medicine is currently promised as a revolutionary new biomedical approach that is holistic rather than reductionist. This article analyzes its concept of holism, both with regard to methods and conceptualization of health and disease. Rather than representing a medical holism associated with basic humanistic ideas, we find a technoscientific holism resulting from altered technological and theoretical circumstances in biology. We argue that this holism, which is aimed at disease prevention and health optimization, points towards an expanded form of medicalization, which we call ‚Äòholistic medicalization‚Äô: Each person‚Äôs whole life process is defined in biomedical, technoscientific terms as quantifiable and controllable and underlain a regime of medical control that is holistic in that it is all-encompassing. It is directed at all levels of functioning, from the molecular to the social, continual throughout life and aimed at managing the whole continuum from cure of disease to optimization of health. We argue that this medicalization is a very concrete materialization of a broader trend in medicine and society, which we call ‚Äòthe medicalization of health and life itself‚Äô. We explicate this holistic medicalization, discuss potential harms and conclude by calling for preventive measures aimed at avoiding eventual harmful effects of overmedicalization in systems medicine (quaternary prevention).},

	abstract = {Background Physical activity has not been objectively measured in prospective cohorts with sufficiently large numbers to reliably detect associations with multiple health outcomes. Technological advances now make this possible. We describe the methods used to collect and analyse accelerometer measured physical activity in over 100,000 participants of the UK Biobank study, and report variation by age, sex, day, time of day, and season. Methods Participants were approached by email to wear a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven days that was posted to them. Physical activity information was extracted from 100Hz raw triaxial acceleration data after calibration, removal of gravity and sensor noise, and identification of wear / non-wear episodes. We report age- and sex-specific wear-time compliance and accelerometer measured physical activity, overall and by hour-of-day, week-weekend day and season. Results 103,712 datasets were received (44.8\% response), with a median wear-time of 6.9 days (IQR:6.5‚Äì7.0). 96,600 participants (93.3\%) provided valid data for physical activity analyses. Vector magnitude, a proxy for overall physical activity, was 7.5\% (2.35mg) lower per decade of age (Cohen‚Äôs d = 0.9). Women had a higher vector magnitude than men, apart from those aged 45-54yrs. There were major differences in vector magnitude by time of day (d = 0.66). Vector magnitude differences between week and weekend days (d = 0.12 for men, d = 0.09 for women) and between seasons (d = 0.27 for men, d = 0.15 for women) were small. Conclusions It is feasible to collect and analyse objective physical activity data in large studies. The summary measure of overall physical activity is lower in older participants and age-related differences in activity are most prominent in the afternoon and evening. This work lays the foundation for studies of physical activity and its health consequences. Our summary variables are part of the UK Biobank dataset and can be used by researchers as exposures, confounding factors or outcome variables in future analyses.},

	abstract = {Background: Greater adoption of wearable devices with multiple sensors may enhance personalized health monitoring, facilitate early detection of some diseases, and further scale up population health screening. However, few studies have explored the utility of data from wearable fitness trackers in cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk prediction.
Objective: This study aimed to investigate the associations between a range of activity metrics derived from a wearable consumer-grade fitness tracker and major modifiable biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease in a working-age population.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 83 working adults. Participants wore Fitbit Charge 2 for 21 consecutive days and went through a health assessment, including fasting blood tests. The following clinical biomarkers were collected: BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood glucose. We used a range of wearable-derived metrics based on steps, heart rate (HR), and energy expenditure, including measures of stability of circadian activity rhythms, sedentary time, and time spent at various intensities of physical activity. Spearman rank correlation was used for preliminary analysis. Multiple linear regression adjusted for potential confounders was used to determine the extent to which each metric of activity was associated with continuous clinical biomarkers. In addition, pairwise multiple regression was used to investigate the significance and mutual dependence of activity metrics when two or more of them had significant association with the same outcome from the previous step of the analysis.
Results: The participants were predominantly middle aged (mean age 44.3 years, SD 12), Chinese (62/83, 75\%), and male (64/83, 77\%). Blood biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease (HDL cholesterol and TGs) were significantly associated with steps-based activity metrics independent of age, gender, ethnicity, education, and shift work, whereas body composition biomarkers (BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio) were significantly associated with energy expenditure‚Äìbased and HR-based metrics when adjusted for the same confounders. Steps-based interdaily stability of circadian activity rhythm was strongly associated with HDL (beta=5.4 per 10\% change; 95\% CI 1.8 to 9.0; P=.005) and TG (beta=‚àí27.7 per 10\% change; 95\% CI ‚àí48.4 to ‚àí7.0; P=.01). Average daily steps were negatively associated with TG (beta=‚àí6.8 per 1000 steps; 95\% CI ‚àí13.0 to ‚àí0.6; P=.04). The difference between average HR and resting HR was significantly associated with BMI (beta=‚àí.5; 95\% CI ‚àí1.0 to ‚àí0.1; P=.01) and waist circumference (beta=‚àí1.3; 95\% CI ‚àí2.4 to ‚àí0.2; P=.03).
Conclusions: Wearable consumer-grade fitness trackers can provide acceptably accurate and meaningful information, which might be used in the risk prediction of cardiometabolic disease. Our results showed the beneficial effects of stable daily patterns of locomotor activity for cardiometabolic health. Study findings should be further replicated with larger population studies.},

	abstract = {The physiologic mechanisms by which the four activities of sleep, sedentary behavior, light-intensity physical activity (LIPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) affect health are related, but these relationships have not been well explored in adults. Research studies have commonly evaluated how time spent in one activity affects health. Because one can only increase time in one activity by decreasing time in another, such studies cannot determine the extent that a health benefit is due to one activity versus due to reallocating time among the other activities. For example, interventions to improve sleep possibly also increase time spent in MVPA. If so, the overall effect of such interventions on risk of premature mortality is due to both more MVPA and better sleep. Further, the potential for interaction between activities to affect health outcomes is largely unexplored. For example, is there a threshold of MVPA minutes per day, above which adverse health effects of sedentary behavior are eliminated? This paper considers the 24-Hour Activity Cycle (24-HAC) model as a paradigm for exploring inter-relatedness of health effects of the four activities. It discusses how to measure time spent in each of the four activities, as well as the analytical and statistical challenges in analyzing data based upon the model, including the inevitable challenge of confounding among activities. The potential usefulness of this model is described by reviewing selected research findings that aided in the creation of the model and discussing future applications of the 24-HAC model.},

We analyzed 1999-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey mortality-linked data, followed up until 2015. In participants aged‚Äâ{\textgreater}‚Äâ30 with measurements of differential white blood cell counts, NLR was calculated and categorized into quartiles. Associations of increased NLR with overall or cause-specific mortality were assessed with Cox proportional hazard regression models, adjusted for potential confounders. Increased NLR was associated with overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.17, per quartile NLR) and mortality due to heart disease (1.17, 1.06-1.29), chronic lower respiratory disease (1.24, 1.04-1.47), influenza/pneumonia (1.26, 1.03-1.54) and kidney disease (1.26, 1.03-1.54). NLR was associated with cancer mortality only in the first follow-up year (HR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.11-1.98). The association with chronic lower respiratory disease mortality was stronger in individuals with prevalent lung diseases (HR 1.46, 95\% CI 1.14-1.88, Pinteraction‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01), while NLR showed positive associations with mortality from heart disease (1.21, 1.07-1.38) and cerebrovascular disease (1.30, 1.04-1.63) only among individuals without these conditions at baseline. NLR is associated with mortality overall and due to certain causes in the general population. Associations over short follow-up intervals and among individuals with conditions at baseline suggest effects of disordered inflammation and immunity on progression of those conditions, while other associations may reflect contributions to disease etiology.},

Today, the core elements of that vision are widely accepted and have been articulated in a series of recent reports by the US Institute of Medicine. Systems approaches to biology and medicine are now beginning to provide patients, consumers and physicians with personalized information about each individual‚Äôs unique health experience of both health and disease at the molecular, cellular and organ levels. This information will make disease care radically more cost effective by personalizing care to each person‚Äôs unique biology and by treating the causes rather than the symptoms of disease. It will also provide the basis for concrete action by consumers to improve their health as they observe the impact of lifestyle decisions. Working together in digitally powered familial and affinity networks, consumers will be able to reduce the incidence of the complex chronic diseases that currently account for 75\% of disease-care costs in the USA.},

	abstract = {Mobile health monitoring via non-invasive wearable sensors is poised to advance telehealth for older adults and other vulnerable populations. Extreme heat and other environmental conditions raise serious health challenges that warrant monitoring of real-time physiological data as people go about their normal activities. Mobile systems could be beneficial for many communities, including elite athletes, military special forces, and at-home geriatric monitoring. While some commercial monitors exist, they are bulky, require reconfiguration, and do not fit seamlessly as a simple wearable device. We designed, prototyped and tested an integrated sensor platform that records heart rate, oxygen saturation, physical activity levels, skin temperature, and galvanic skin response. The device uses a small microcontroller to integrate the measurements and store data directly on the device for up to 48+ h. continuously. The device was compared to clinical standards for calibration and performance benchmarking. We found that our system compared favorably with clinical measures, such as fingertip pulse oximetry and infrared thermometry, with high accuracy and correlation. Our novel platform would facilitate an individualized approach to care, particularly those whose access to healthcare facilities is limited. The platform also can be used as a research tool to study physiological responses to a variety of environmental conditions, such as extreme heat, and can be customized to incorporate new sensors to explore other lines of inquiry.},

We investigated the use of these devices to monitor human physiological changes during various activities and their role in managing health and diagnosing and analyzing disease. By recording over 250,000 daily measurements for up to 43 individuals, we found personalized circadian differences in physiological parameters, replicating previous physiological findings. Interestingly, we found striking changes in particular environments, such as airline flights (decreased peripheral capillary oxygen saturation [SpO2] and increased radiation exposure). These events are associated with physiological macro-phenotypes such as fatigue, providing a strong association between reduced pressure/oxygen and fatigue on high-altitude flights. Importantly, we combined biosensor information with frequent medical measurements and made two important observations: First, wearable devices were useful in identification of early signs of Lyme disease and inflammatory responses; we used this information to develop a personalized, activity-based normalization framework to identify abnormal physiological signals from longitudinal data for facile disease detection. Second, wearables distinguish physiological differences between insulin-sensitive and -resistant individuals. Overall, these results indicate that portable biosensors provide useful information for monitoring personal activities and physiology and are likely to play an important role in managing health and enabling affordable health care access to groups traditionally limited by socioeconomic class or remote geography.},

In line with the IoT concept, many commercial wearables have been introduced in recent years, which differ from the usual devices in that they use the term ‚Äúsmart‚Äù alongside the terms ‚Äúwatches‚Äù, ‚Äúglasses‚Äù, and ‚Äújewellery‚Äù. Commercially available wearables aim to enhance smartphone functionality by enabling payment for commercial items or monitoring physical activity. However, what is the trend of scientific production about the concept of wearables regarding environmental monitoring issues? What are the main areas of interest covered by scientific production? What are the main findings and limitations of the developed solution in this field? The methodology used to answer the above questions is based on a systematic review. The data were acquired following a reproducible methodology. The main result is that, among the thermal, visual, acoustic, and air quality environmental factors, the last one is the most considered when using wearables even though in combination with some others. Another relevant finding is that of the acquired studies; in only one, the authors shared their wearables as an open-source device, and it will probably be necessary to encourage researchers to consider open-source as a means to promote scalability and proliferation of new wearables customized to cover different domains.},

This requires objective measurement of the time at which a meal takes place, the duration of the meal, and what the individual eats. Smartwatches and similar wrist-worn devices are an emerging technology that offers the possibility of practical and real-time eating monitoring in an unobtrusive, accessible, and affordable way. To this end, we present a novel approach for the detection of eating segments with a wrist-worn device and fusion of deep and classical machine learning. It integrates a novel data selection method to create the training dataset, and a method that incorporates knowledge from raw and virtual sensor modalities for training with highly imbalanced datasets. The proposed method was evaluated using data from 12 subjects recorded in the wild, without any restriction about the type of meals that could be consumed, the cutlery used for the meal, or the location where the meal took place. The recordings consist of data from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. The experiments show that our method for detection of eating segments achieves precision of 0.85, recall of 0.81, and F1-score of 0.82 in a person-independent manner. The results obtained in this study indicate that reliable eating detection using in the wild recorded data is possible with the use of wearable sensors on the wrist.},

Its use has historically been focused on single modal data. Attempts to improve prediction and mimic the multimodal nature of clinical expert decision-making has been met in the biomedical field of machine learning by fusing disparate data. This review was conducted to summarize the current studies in this field and identify topics ripe for future research. We conducted this review in accordance with the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews to characterize multi-modal data fusion in health. Search strings were established and used in databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEEXplore from 2011 to 2021. A final set of 128 articles were included in the analysis. The most common health areas utilizing multi-modal methods were neurology and oncology. Early fusion was the most common data merging strategy. Notably, there was an improvement in predictive performance when using data fusion. Lacking from the papers were clear clinical deployment strategies, FDA-approval, and analysis of how using multimodal approaches from diverse sub-populations may improve biases and healthcare disparities. These findings provide a summary on multimodal data fusion as applied to health diagnosis/prognosis problems. Few papers compared the outputs of a multimodal approach with a unimodal prediction. However, those that did achieved an average increase of 6.4\% in predictive accuracy. Multi-modal machine learning, while more robust in its estimations over unimodal methods, has drawbacks in its scalability and the time-consuming nature of information concatenation.},

Application of omics to study human health has created a new era of opportunities for epidemiology research. However, approaches to characterize exogenous health triggers have largely not leveraged advances in analytical platforms and big data. In this review, we highlight the exposome, which is defined as the cumulative measure of exposure and biological responses across a lifetime as a cornerstone for new epidemiology approaches to study complex and preventable human diseases.

Recent findings
While no universal approach exists to measure the entirety of the exposome, use of high-resolution mass spectrometry methods provide distinct advantages over traditional biomonitoring and have provided key advances necessary for exposome research. Application to different study designs and recommendations for combining exposome data with novel data analytic frameworks to study complex interactions of multiple stressors are also discussed.

Summary
Even though challenges still need to be addressed, advances in methods to characterize the exposome provide exciting new opportunities for epidemiology to support fundamental discoveries to improve public health.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are an inherent property of all living systems and an essential part of the external and internal temporal order. They enable organisms to be synchronized with their periodic environment and guarantee the optimal functioning of organisms. Any disturbances, so-called circadian disruptions, may have adverse consequences for health, physical and mental performance, and wellbeing. The environmental light‚Äìdark cycle is the main zeitgeber for circadian rhythms. Moreover, regular physical activity is most useful. Not only does it have general favorable effects on the cardiovascular system, the energy metabolism and mental health, for example, but it may also stabilize the circadian system via feedback effects on the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the main circadian pacemaker. Regular physical activity helps to maintain high-amplitude circadian rhythms, particularly of clock gene expression in the SCN. It promotes their entrainment to external periodicities and improves the internal synchronization of various circadian rhythms. This in turn promotes health and wellbeing. In experiments on Djungarian hamsters, voluntary access to a running wheel not only stabilized the circadian activity rhythm, but intensive wheel running even reestablished the rhythm in arrhythmic individuals. Moreover, their cognitive abilities were restored. Djungarian hamsters of the arrhythmic phenotype in which the SCN do not generate a circadian signal not only have a diminished cognitive performance, but their social memory is also compromised. Voluntary wheel running restored these abilities simultaneously with the reestablishment of the circadian activity rhythm. Intensively exercising Syrian hamsters are less anxious, more resilient to social defeat, and show less defensive/submissive behaviors, i.e., voluntary exercise may promote self-confidence. Similar effects were described for humans. The aim of the present paper is to summarize the current knowledge concerning the effects of physical activity on the stability of the circadian system and the corresponding consequences for physical and mental performance.},

	abstract = {Traditional risk factors for obesity and the metabolic syndrome, such as excess energy intake and lack of physical activity, cannot fully explain the high prevalence of these conditions. Insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment predispose individuals to poor metabolic health and promote weight gain and have received increased research attention in the past 10 years. Insufficient sleep is defined as sleeping less than recommended for health benefits, whereas circadian misalignment is defined as wakefulness and food intake occurring when the internal circadian system is promoting sleep. This Review discusses the impact of insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment in humans on appetite hormones (focusing on ghrelin, leptin and peptide-YY), energy expenditure, food intake and choice, and risk of obesity. Some potential strategies to reduce the adverse effects of sleep disruption on metabolic health are provided and future research priorities are highlighted. Millions of individuals worldwide do not obtain sufficient sleep for healthy metabolic functions. Furthermore, modern working patterns, lifestyles and technologies are often not conducive to adequate sleep at times when the internal physiological clock is promoting it (for example, late-night screen time, shift work and nocturnal social activities). Efforts are needed to highlight the importance of optimal sleep and circadian health in the maintenance of metabolic health and body weight regulation.},

We aimed to (a) assess the cross-sectional and prospective associations of 22 inflammation-related plasma markers and a signature of inflammaging with epigenetic aging and (b) determine whether epigenetic aging and inflammaging are independently associated with mortality. Blood samples from 940 participants in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study collected at baseline (1990‚Äì1994) and follow-up (2003‚Äì2007) were assayed for DNA methylation and 22 inflammation-related markers, including well-established markers (eg, interleukins and C-reactive protein) and metabolites of the tryptophan‚Äìkynurenine pathway. Four measures of epigenetic aging (PhenoAge, GrimAge, DunedinPoAm, and Zhang) and a signature of inflammaging were considered, adjusted for age, and transformed to Z scores. Associations were assessed using linear regression, and mortality hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) were estimated using Cox regression. Cross-sectionally, most inflammation-related markers were associated with epigenetic aging measures, although with generally modest effect sizes (regression coefficients per SD ‚â§ 0.26) and explaining altogether between 1\% and 11\% of their variation. Prospectively, baseline inflammation-related markers were not, or only weakly, associated with epigenetic aging after 11 years of follow-up. Epigenetic aging and inflammaging were strongly and independently associated with mortality, for example, inflammaging: HR = 1.41, 95\% CI = 1.27‚Äì1.56, p = 2 √ó 10‚àí10, which was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for 4 epigenetic aging measures: HR = 1.35, 95\% CI = 1.22‚Äì1.51, p = 7 √ó 10‚àí9). Although cross-sectionally associated with epigenetic aging, inflammation-related markers accounted for a modest proportion of its variation. Inflammaging and epigenetic aging are essentially nonoverlapping markers of biological aging and may be used jointly to predict mortality.},

Results found that the Klemera and Doubal method was the most reliable predictor of mortality and performed significantly better than chronological age. Furthermore, when included with chronological age in a model, Klemera and Doubal method had more robust predictive ability and caused chronological age to no longer be significantly associated with mortality. Given the potential of BA to highlight heterogeneity, the Klemera and Doubal method algorithm may be useful for studying a number of questions regarding the biology of aging.},

The existing literature focuses on the means, while the nature and correlates of sleep/wake IIV are not well understood. A systematic search of records in five major databases from inception to November 2014 identified 53 peer-reviewed empirical publications that examined correlates of sleep/wake IIV in adults. Overall, this literature appeared unsystematic and post hoc, with under-developed theoretical frameworks and inconsistent methodologies. Correlates most consistently associated with greater IIV in one or more aspects of sleep/wake patterns were: younger age, non-White race/ethnicity, living alone, physical health conditions, higher body mass index, weight gain, bipolar and unipolar depression symptomatology, stress, and evening chronotype; symptoms of insomnia and poor sleep were associated with higher sleep/wake IIV, which was reduced following sleep interventions. The effects of experimentally reduced sleep/wake IIV on daytime functioning were inconclusive. In extending current understanding of sleep/wake patterns beyond the mean values, IIV should be incorporated as an additional dimension when sleep is examined across multiple days. Theoretical and methodological shortcomings in the existing literature, and opportunities for future research are discussed.},

Subjects: 112 non-institutionalized subjects were studied in 1984 and again 10 years later (ages in 1984 ranged from 53-82 years). Protocol: on each occasion subjects recorded in a diary their times of retiring and rising and of taking meals, during a 'typical week'. They also recorded whether they lived alone or with somebody. Analysis: the diaries were scored to establish any effects of age or living alone on the timing and variability of their lifestyle.
Results: age was associated with changes in the sleep/wake schedule and mealtimes and a decrease of daily variation in these variables. When these changes were compared in subjects living alone and with somebody, the increase in time spent in bed and the decreases in variability of times of rising and meals were more marked in subjects living with somebody.
Conclusions: a deteriorating body clock contributes to some of these changes, but an increasingly inflexible lifestyle will offset some of the effects of this decline in circadian rhythmicity.},

We aimed at evaluating, at a large epidemiological level, the possible association of low-grade inflammation, as measured by a composite score, with overall mortality risk. We conducted a population-based prospective investigation on 20,337 adult subjects free from major hematological disease and acute inflammatory status, randomly recruited from the general population of the Moli-sani study. A low-grade inflammation score was obtained from the sum of 10-tiles of plasmatic (C-reactive protein) and cellular (leukocyte and platelet counts, granulocyte/lymphocyte ratio) biomarkers of low-grade inflammation; higher levels indicated increased low-grade inflammation. Hazard ratios were calculated using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models with 95\% confidence intervals. At the end of follow-up (median 7.6 years), 837 all-cause deaths were recorded. As compared to subjects in the lowest quartile of the low-grade inflammation score, those in the highest category had a significantly increased risk in overall mortality (HR=1.44; 1.17‚Äì1.77), independently of possible confounders, including the presence of chronic diseases and a number of health-related behaviors. The magnitude of the association of low-grade inflammation with mortality was relatively higher in type 2 diabetic patients (HR=2.90; 1.74‚Äì4.84) and in individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease (HR=2.48; 1.50‚Äì4.11) as compared to their counterparts who were free from the disease. In conclusion, an elevated degree of low-grade inflammation, as measured by a composite score of inflammatory biomarkers, is an independent risk factor for total mortality in an apparently healthy adult general population.},

Using k-mean cluster analytics, in study 1, we identified biochemical clusters (based on C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, fibrinogen, cortisol, and creatinine) and examined their link to diseases. Analyses were conducted in a US American sample (from the Midlife in the US study, N‚Äâ=‚Äâ1234) and validated in a Japanese sample (from the Midlife in Japan study, N‚Äâ=‚Äâ378). In study 2, we investigated the link of the biochemical¬†clusters from study 1¬†to childhood maltreatment (CM). The three identified biochemical clusters included one cluster (with high inflammatory signaling and low cortisol and creatinine concentrations) indicating the highest disease burden. This high-risk cluster also reported the highest CM exposure. The current study demonstrates how biomarkers can be utilized to identify individuals with a high disease burden and thus, may help to target these high-risk individuals with tailored prevention/intervention, towards personalized medicine. Furthermore, our findings raise the question whether the found biochemical clusters have predictive character, as a tool to identify high-risk individuals enabling targeted prevention. The finding that CM was mostly prevalent in the high-risk cluster provides first hints that the clusters could indeed have predictive character and highlight CM as a central disease susceptibility factor and possibly as a leverage point for disease prevention/intervention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus 2019 is a pandemic that has spread worldwide, threatening human health. The main cause of death in patients with COVID-19 is a systemic pro-inflammatory mechanism that quickly progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Hematological ratios as affordable indicators of inflammatory response were studied in COVID-19 patients. The study aimed to study the importance of the blood cell indexes of the systemic inflammatory response, as the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI), neutrophils lymphocyte to platelet ratio (NLPR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and, systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) in predicting intensive care unit (ICU) admission of COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: 495 COVID-19 patients managed in four tertiary centers; divided into non-ICU and ICU groups.
RESULTS: Total leucocyte count (TLC), AISI, NLPR, SII, and SIRI were more elevated in the ICU group (P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001 for all except AMC P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.006), while this group had less absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.047). We estimated the optimal cut-off values of the hematological ratio; AISI (729), NLPR (0.0195), SII (1346), and SIRI (2.5). SII had the highest specificity (95.6\%), while NLPR had the highest sensitivity (61.3\%). Age, AISI, CRP, D-dimer, and oxygen aid were the independent predictors for ICU admission in COVID-19 in multivariate logistic regression.
CONCLUSION: AISI is a predictor for severity and ICU admission in COVID-19 patients, SII is a predictor of survival, while NLPR and SIRI have an additive role that needs further evaluation.},

After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, and disease stage, only the AISI was significantly associated with mortality (HR 1.0013, 95\% CI 1.0003‚Äì1.0023, p = 0.015). Patients with AISI {\textless}434 and ‚â•434 had a median survival from the diagnosis of 35.3 ¬± 15.2 and 26.6 ¬± 16.3 months (p = 0.015), and a four-year survival rate of 54\% and 34\%, respectively. The AISI, easily derivable from routine laboratory tests, is independently associated with mortality in patients with IPF. Prospective studies in larger cohorts are required to confirm this association.},

Often, these data are merely inspected visually without computation of descriptive parameters, in part due to the lack of user-friendly software. To address this deficit, we developed a package for R Core Team [6], that allows computing several non-parametric measures from actigraphy data. Specifically, it computes the interdaily stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV) and relative amplitude (RA) of activity and gives the start times and average activity values of M10 (i.e. the ten hours with maximal activity) and L5 (i.e. the five hours with least activity). Two functions compute these ‚Äòclassical‚Äô parameters and handle either single or multiple files. Two other functions additionally allow computing an L-value (i.e. the least activity value) for a user-defined time span termed ‚ÄòLflex‚Äô value. A plotting option is included in all functions. The package can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archives Network (CRAN). ‚Ä¢The package ‚ÄònparACT‚Äô for R serves the non-parametric analysis of actigraphy data.‚Ä¢Computed parameters include interdaily stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV) and relative amplitude (RA) as well as start times and average activity during the 10h with maximal and the 5h with minimal activity (i.e. M10 and L5).},

	abstract = {Background Higher levels of physical activity (PA) are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, uncertainty exists on whether the inverse relationship between PA and incidence of CVD is greater at the highest levels of PA. Past studies have mostly relied on self-reported evidence from questionnaire-based PA, which is crude and cannot capture all PA undertaken. We investigated the association between accelerometer-measured moderate, vigorous, and total PA and incident CVD. Methods and findings We obtained accelerometer-measured moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity physical activities and total volume of PA, over a 7-day period in 2013‚Äì2015, for 90,211 participants without prior or concurrent CVD in the UK Biobank cohort. Participants in the lowest category of total PA smoked more, had higher body mass index and C-reactive protein, and were diagnosed with hypertension. PA was associated with 3,617 incident CVD cases during 440,004 person-years of follow-up (median (interquartile range [IQR]): 5.2 (1.2) years) using Cox regression models. We found a linear dose‚Äìresponse relationship for PA, whether measured as moderate-intensity, vigorous-intensity, or as total volume, with risk of incident of CVD. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals for increasing quarters of the PA distribution relative to the lowest fourth were for moderate-intensity PA: 0.71 (0.65, 0.77), 0.59 (0.54, 0.65), and 0.46 (0.41, 0.51); for vigorous-intensity PA: 0.70 (0.64, 0.77), 0.54 (0.49,0.59), and 0.41 (0.37,0.46); and for total volume of PA: 0.73 (0.67, 0.79), 0.63 (0.57, 0.69), and 0.47 (0.43, 0.52). We took account of potential confounders but unmeasured confounding remains a possibility, and while removal of early deaths did not affect the estimated HRs, we cannot completely dismiss the likelihood that reverse causality has contributed to the findings. Another possible limitation of this work is the quantification of PA intensity-levels based on methods validated in relatively small studies. Conclusions In this study, we found no evidence of a threshold for the inverse association between objectively measured moderate, vigorous, and total PA with CVD. Our findings suggest that PA is not only associated with lower risk for of CVD, but the greatest benefit is seen for those who are active at the highest level.},

Design Acronyms obtained through a literature search of Pubmed.gov followed by a standardised assessment of acronym quality (BEAUTY and CHEATING criteria).
Participants Randomised controlled trials within psychiatry, rheumatology, pulmonary medicine, endocrinology, and cardiology published between 2000 and 2012.
Main outcome measures Prevalence proportion of acronyms and composite quality score for acronyms over time.
Results 14 965 publications were identified, of which 18.3\% (n=2737) contained an acronym in the title. Acronym use was more common among cardiological studies than among the other four medical specialties (40\% v 8-15\% in 2012, P{\textless}0.001). Except for within cardiology, the prevalence of acronyms increased over time, with the average prevalence proportion among the remaining four specialties increasing from 4.0\% to 12.4\% from 2000 to 2012 (P{\textless}0.001). The median combined acronym quality score decreased significantly over the study period (P{\textless}0.001), from a median 9.25 in 2000 to 5.50 in 2012.
Conclusion From 2000 to 2012 the prevalence of acronyms in trial reports increased, coinciding with a substantial decrease in the technical and aesthetic quality of the acronyms. Strict enforcement of current guidelines on acronym construction by journal editors is necessary to ensure the proper use of acronyms in the future.},

High frequency (HF) heart rate variability (HRV) has long been accepted as an index of cardiac vagal control. Recent studies report relationships between HF-HRV and indices of positive and negative affect, personality traits and wellbeing but these studies generally are based on small and selective samples.

Method
These relationships were examined using data from 967 participants in the second Midlife in the US (MIDUS II) study. Participants completed survey questionnaires on wellbeing and affect. HF-HRV was measured at rest. A hierarchical series of regression analyses examined relationships between these various indices and HF-HRV before and after adjustment for relevant demographic and biomedical factors.

Results
Significant inverse relationships were found only between indices of negative affect and HF-HRV. Relationships between indices of psychological and hedonic wellbeing and positive affect failed to reach significance.

Conclusions
These findings raise questions about relationships between cardiac parasympathetic modulation, emotion regulation, and indices of wellbeing.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study evaluates the associations between people's trait-like patterns of stress in daily life (stressor frequency, perceived stressor severity, affective reactivity to stressors, and negative affect) and laboratory-assessed heart rate variability (HRV).
Methods: Data were collected from 909 participants aged 35 to 85 years in the Midlife in the United States Study. Participants reported negative affect and minor stressful events during telephone interviews on 8 consecutive evenings. On a separate occasion, HRV was measured from electrocardiograph recordings taken at rest during a laboratory-based psychophysiology protocol. Regression models were used to evaluate the associations between daily stress processes and three log-transformed HRV indices: standard deviation of R-R intervals (SDRR), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), and high-frequency power (high-frequency HRV [HF-HRV]). Analyses were adjusted for demographics, body mass index, comorbid conditions, medications, physical activity, and smoking.
Results: Stressor frequency was unrelated to HRV (r values ranging from ‚àí0.04 to ‚àí0.01, p values {\textgreater}.20). However, people with greater perceived stressor severity had lower resting SDRR (fully adjusted B [standard error \{SE\}] = ‚àí0.05 [0.02]), RMSSD (‚àí0.08 [0.03]), and HF-HRV (‚àí0.16 [0.07]). Individuals with more pronounced affective reactivity to stressors also had lower levels of all three HRV indices (SDRR: B [SE] = ‚àí0.28 [0.14]; RMSSD: ‚àí0.44 [0.19]; HF-HRV: ‚àí0.96 [0.37]). Furthermore, aggregated daily negative affect was linked to reduced RMSSD (B [SE] = ‚àí0.16 [0.08]) and HF-HRV (‚àí0.35 [0.15]).
Conclusions: In a national sample, individual differences in daily negative affect and responses to daily stressors were more strongly related to cardiovascular autonomic regulation than the frequency of such stressors.},

	abstract = {Cardiac vagal control (CVC), an index of parasympathetic contribution to cardiac regulation, has been linked to enhanced executive functioning (EF). However, findings to date have been based on small or unique samples. Additionally, previous studies assessed the CVC-EF link only during rest or recovery period from a cognitive challenge, but not during both states. In the present study, data on 817 socioeconomically diverse participants were obtained from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) study. As part of this study, participants completed cognitive tests, including EF, along with laboratory-based measures of CVC during rest and following recovery from a cognitive challenge. Regression analyses adjusting for respiratory rate revealed no effect of CVC at rest or during recovery on a global index of EF. However, exploratory post-hoc analyses of the components of the global EF index revealed a significant association between faster vagal recovery and better attention-switching and response inhibition abilities, as indexed by faster reaction time to the mixed SGST. This association remained significant after controlling for demographic, clinical (BMI, diseases and medications altering cardiac autonomic functioning, etc.), and health behavior covariates (Beta = .148, p = .010). Our findings suggest that future studies may need to investigate the links of CVC to specific EF abilities, rather than global measures of EF. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of assessing CVC during both rest and recovery from a cognitive challenge. The authors discuss the putative neurobiological underpinning of this link, as well as suggestions for future basic and clinical research.},

Data were collected from firefighters during 24-h shifts using sensor belts equipped with a dry-lead electrocardiograph (ECG) and a three-axial accelerometer. Levels of stress experienced during fire incidents were evaluated via a brief self-assessment questionnaire. Types of physical activity were distinguished basing on accelerometer readings, and heart rate variability (HRV) time series were segmented accordingly into corresponding fragments. Those segments were classified as stress/no-stress conditions. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed true positive classification as stress condition for 15\% of incidents (while maintaining almost zero False Positive Rate), which parallels the amount of truly stressful incidents reported in the questionnaires. These results show a firm correspondence between the perceived stress level and physiological data. Psychophysiological measurements are reliable indicators of stress even in ecological settings and appear promising for chronic stress monitoring in high-risk jobs, such as firefighting.},

As various wearable sensors become popular, it becomes possible for individuals to acquire their own relevant sensory data and to automatically assess their stress level on the go. Previous studies for stress analysis were conducted in the controlled laboratory and clinic settings. These studies are not suitable for stress monitoring in one's daily life as various physical activities may affect the physiological signals. In this paper, we address such issue by integrating two modalities of sensors, i.e., HRV sensors and accelerometers, to monitor the perceived stress levels in daily life. We gathered both the heart and the motion data from 8 participants continuously for about 2 weeks. We then extracted features from both sensory data and compared the existing machine learning methods for learning personalized models to interpret the perceived stress levels. Experimental results showed that Bagging classifier with feature selection is able to achieve a prediction accuracy 85.7\%, indicating our stress monitoring on daily basis is fairly practical.},

Using absolute intensity PA thresholds, older adults registered fewer activity counts per day with more sedentary time and lesser amounts of light, moderate, and vigorous PA (p \&lt; .05). Persons with higher relative and lower absolute PA intensity had poorer functional performance and higher subclinical disease indicators.These findings suggest that time spent in moderate or higher intensity activities may not be lower with age after considering changes in physiology, functional ability, and subclinical disease burden and highlight the need for more age- and ability-specific PA research to inform future interventions and public health guidelines.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due to the lack of research, this study aimed to assess the association between the specific range of heart rate and cardiovascular (CV) death in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients.
HYPOTHESIS: Heart rate of 70-79‚Äâbpm may be associated with reduced risk of CV death in CHD patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study collected the data of CHD patients from the eight cycles of the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The included patients were divided into four groups: {\textless}60, 60-69, 70-79, and ‚â•80‚Äâbpm. The start of follow-up date was the mobile examination center date, the last follow-up date was December 31, 2015. The average follow-up time was 81.70 months, and the longest follow-up time was 200 months. Competing risk models were developed to evaluate the association between heart rate and CV death, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 1648 patients with CHD were included in this study. CHD patients at heart rate of {\textless}60 (HR, 1.35; 95\% CI, 1.34-1.36), 60-69 (HR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.06) or ‚â•80 (HR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.38-1.41) bpm had a higher risk of CV death than those at heart rate of 70-79‚Äâbpm.
CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate of {\textless}70 or ‚â•80‚Äâbpm was associated with an elevated risk of CV death among CHD patients. Continuous monitoring of heart rate may help to screen for health risks and offer early interventions to corresponding patients.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Decreased cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, little is known how the interaction of diet, physical activity (PA), and sedentary time (ST) affects CRF among adolescents. By using a nationally-representative sample of U.S. adolescents, we used cluster analysis to investigate the interactions of these behaviors on CRF. We hypothesized that distinct clustering patterns exist and that less healthy clusters are associated with lower CRF.

Methods
We used 2003‚Äì04 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data for persons aged 12‚Äì19 years (N=1225). PA and ST were measured objectively by accelerometer, and the American Heart Association Healthy Diet Score quantified diet quality. 
VÀôO2max was measured by sub-maximal treadmill exercise test. We performed cluster analysis to identify sex-specific clustering of diet, PA, and ST. Adjusting for accelerometer wear-time, age, body mass index (BMI), race/ethnicity, and the poverty-to-income ratio, we performed sex-stratified linear regression analysis to evaluate the association of cluster with 
VÀôO2max.

Results
Three clusters were identified for girls and boys. For girls, there was no difference across clusters for age (p=0.1), weight (p=0.3), and BMI (p=0.5) and no relationship between clusters and 
VÀôO2max. For boys, the youngest cluster (p{\textless}0.01) had three healthy behaviors, weighed less, and was associated with a higher 
VÀôO2max compared with the two older clusters.

Conclusions
We observed clustering of diet, PA, and ST in U.S. adolescents. Specific patterns were associated with lower 
VÀôO2max for boys, suggesting that our clusters may help identify adolescent boys most in need of interventions.},

	abstract = {Background

Spontaneous heart rate fluctuations contain rich information related to health and illness in terms of physiological complexity, an accepted indicator of plasticity and adaptability. However, it is challenging to make inferences on complexity from shorter, more practical epochs of data. Distribution entropy (DistEn) is a recently introduced complexity measure that is designed specifically for shorter duration heartbeat recordings. We hypothesized that reduced DistEn predicted increased mortality in a large population cohort.

Method and Results

The prognostic value of DistEn was examined in 7631 middle‚Äêolder‚Äìaged UK Biobank participants who had 2‚Äêminute resting ECGs conducted (mean age, 59.5¬†years; 60.4\% women). During a median follow‚Äêup period of 7.8¬†years, 451 (5.9\%) participants died. In Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for demographics, lifestyle factors, physical activity, cardiovascular risks, and comorbidities, for each 1‚ÄêSD decrease in DistEn, the risk increased by 36\%, 56\%, and 73\% for all‚Äêcause, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease‚Äìrelated mortality, respectively. These effect sizes were equivalent to the risk of death from being {\textgreater}5¬†years older, having been a former smoker, or having diabetes mellitus. Lower DistEn was most predictive of death in those {\textless}55¬†years with a prior myocardial infarction, representing an additional 56\% risk for mortality compared with older participants without prior myocardial infarction. These observations remained after controlling for traditional mortality predictors, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability.

Conclusions

Resting heartbeat complexity from short, resting ECGs was independently associated with mortality in middle‚Äê to older‚Äêaged adults. These risks appear most pronounced in middle‚Äêaged participants with prior MI, and may uniquely contribute to mortality risk screening.},

These garments have integrated multipurpose sensors that monitor their activities while in action. To this aim, we have developed an algorithm that combines both features extracted from the signal of a triaxial accelerometer and one ECG lead. Microprocessors integrated in the garments detect the signal magnitude area of inertial acceleration, step frequency, trunk inclination, heart rate (HR), and HR trend in real time. Given these inputs, a classifier assigns these signals to nine classes differentiating between certain physical activities (walking, running, moving on site), intensities (intense, mild, or at rest) and postures (lying down, standing up). Specific classes will be identified as dangerous to the rescuer during operation, such as, ¬øsubject motionless lying down¬ø or ¬øsubject resting with abnormal HR.¬ø Laboratory tests were carried out on seven healthy adult subjects with the collection of over 4.5 h of data.

	abstract = {Heart disease, caused by low heart rate, is one of the most significant causes of mortality in the world today. Therefore, it is critical to monitor heart health by identifying the deviation in the heart rate very early, which makes it easier to detect and manage the heart's function irregularities at a very early stage. The fast-growing use of advanced technology such as the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable monitoring systems and artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare systems has continued to play a vital role in the analysis of huge amounts of health-based data for early and accurate disease detection and diagnosis for personalized treatment and prognosis evaluation. It is then important to analyze the effectiveness of using data analytics and machine learning to monitor and predict heart rates using wearable device (accelerometer)-generated data. Hence, in this study, we explored a number of powerful data-driven models including the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) regressor, decision tree regressor, random forest regressor and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network algorithm for the analysis of accelerometer data to make future HR predictions from the accelerometer's univariant HR time-series data from healthy people. The performances of the models were evaluated under different durations. Evaluated on a very recently created data set, our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using an ARIMA model with a walk-forward validation and linear regression for predicting heart rate under all durations and other models for durations longer than 1 min. The results of this study show that employing these data analytics techniques can be used to predict future HR more accurately using accelerometers.},

A subsample also participated in a seven-day sleep study (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ282). Perceived social support and strain from partner, family, and friends were examined by self-report questionnaires. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, sleep daily diary, and actigraphy to measure both subjective and objective sleep. Social support and strain were both associated with sleep outcomes. Specifically, higher social support was associated with fewer daily reports of light sleep and feeling more rested in the morning, while higher social strain was associated with higher clinical sleep disturbance. For women, but not men, social support was significantly associated with lower daily sleep disturbance while perceived social strain was significantly associated with higher daily sleep disturbance, lighter sleep, feeling less rested in the morning, lower sleep efficiency, and longer sleep onset latency. Mainly among women, social support and strain are associated with an important transdiagnostic health outcome‚Äìsleep‚Äìwhich may have implications for a wide range of health disparities. Interpersonal stressors may increase health risks differently for women compared to men and one mechanism that may link social relationships to long-term health outcomes is sleep.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives
Emerging evidence supports a multidimensional perspective of sleep in the context of health. The sleep health model, and composite sleep health score, are increasingly used in research. However, specific cutoff values that differentiate ‚Äúgood‚Äù from ‚Äúpoor‚Äù sleep, have not been empirically derived and its relationship to cardiometabolic health is less-well understood. We empirically derived cutoff values for sleep health dimensions and examined the relationship between sleep health and cardiometabolic morbidity.

Methods
Participants from two independent Biomarker Studies in the MIDUS II (N = 432, 39.8\% male, age = 56.92 ¬± 11.45) and MIDUS Refresher (N = 268, 43.7\% male, age = 51.68 ¬± 12.70) cohorts completed a 1-week study where sleep was assessed with daily diaries and wrist actigraphy. Self-reported physician diagnoses, medication use, and blood values were used to calculate total cardiometabolic morbidity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated in the MIDUS II cohort for each sleep health dimension to determine cutoff values. Using derived cutoff values, logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between sleep health scores and cardiometabolic morbidity in the MIDUS Refresher cohort, controlling for traditional risk factors.

Results
Empirically derived sleep health cutoff values aligned reasonably well to cutoff values previously published in the sleep health literature and remained robust across physical and mental health outcomes. Better sleep health was significantly associated with a lower odds of cardiometabolic morbidity (OR [95\% CI] = 0.901 [0.814‚Äì0.997], p = .044).

Conclusions
These results contribute to the ongoing development of the sleep health model and add to the emerging research supporting a multidimensional perspective of sleep and health.},

As part of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), a national longitudinal study of health and well-being, subjects (N¬†=¬†265) (i) completed a phone-based interview that assessed generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder symptoms at enrollment, (ii) participated in a one-week actigraphy study 9‚Äì14 years later, and (iii) completed a long-term follow-up, phone-based interview to quantify generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder symptoms 17‚Äì18 years from initial enrollment. A deep auto-encoder paired with a multi-layered ensemble deep learning model was leveraged to predict whether participants experienced increased anxiety disorder symptoms across this 17‚Äì18 year period.
Results
Out-of-sample cross-validated results suggested that wearable movement data could significantly predict which individuals would experience symptom deterioration (AUC¬†=¬†0.696, CI [0.598, 0.793], 84.6\% sensitivity, 52.7\% specificity, balanced accuracy¬†=¬†68.7\%).
Conclusions
Passive wearable actigraphy data could be utilized to predict long-term deterioration of anxiety disorder symptoms. Future studies should examine whether these methods could be implemented to prevent deterioration of anxiety disorder symptoms.},

Multiple physiological and behavioral lifestyle features can now be recorded unobtrusively in daily-life using wearable sensors. The aim of the current study was to identify a distinct set of physiological and behavioral lifestyle features that are associated with elevated levels of chronic stress across different stress sources.MethodsFor that, 140 healthy female participants completed the Trier inventory for chronic stress (TICS) before wearing the Fitbit Charge3 sensor for seven consecutive days while maintaining their daily routine. Physiological and lifestyle features that were extracted from sensor data, alongside demographic features, were used to predict high versus low chronic stress with support vector machine classifiers, applying out-of-sample model testing.ResultsThe model achieved 79\% classification accuracy for chronic stress from a social tension source. A mixture of physiological (resting heart-rate, heart-rate circadian characteristics), lifestyle (steps count, sleep onset and sleep regularity) and non-sensor demographic features (smoking status) contributed to this classification.ConclusionAs wearable technologies continue to rapidly evolve, integration of daily-life indicators could improve our understanding of chronic stress and its impact of physiology and behavior.},

            There is increasing interest in applying a precision medicine approach to understanding exercise as a potential treatment for cancer. We aimed to inform this new approach by appraising epidemiologic literature relating postdiagnosis physical activity to cancer outcomes overall and by molecular/genetic subgroups. Across 26 studies of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer patients, a 37\% reduction was seen in risk of cancer-specific mortality, comparing the most versus the least active patients (pooled relative risk = 0.63; 95\% confidence interval: 0.54‚Äì0.73). Risks of recurrence or recurrence/cancer-specific death (combined outcome) were also reduced based on fewer studies. We identified ten studies of associations between physical activity and cancer outcomes by molecular or genetic markers. Two studies showed statistically significant risk reductions in breast cancer mortality/recurrence for the most (versus least) physically active estrogen receptor‚Äìpositive/progesterone receptor‚Äìpositive (ER+/PR+) patients, while others showed risk reductions among ER‚àíPR‚àí and triple-negative patients. In colorectal cancer, four studies showed statistically significant risk reductions in cancer-specific mortality for patients with high (versus low) physical activity and P21 expression, P27 expression, nuclear CTNNB1‚àí, PTGS2 (COX-2)+, or IRS1 low/negative status. One prostate cancer study showed effect modification by Gleason score. As a means to enhance this evidence, future observational studies are needed that will measure physical activity objectively before and after diagnosis, use standardized definitions for outcomes, control for competing risks, assess nonlinear dose‚Äìresponse relations, and consider reverse causality. Ultimately, randomized controlled trials with clinical cancer outcomes and a correlative component will provide the best evidence of causality, relating exercise to cancer outcomes, overall and for molecular and genetic subgroups.

	abstract = {Chronic diseases (i.e., noncommunicable diseases), mainly cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory diseases and type-2-diabetes, are now the leading cause of death, disability and diminished quality of life on the planet. Moreover, these diseases are also a major financial burden worldwide, significantly impacting the economy of many countries. Healthcare systems and medicine have progressively improved upon the ability to address infectious diseases and react to adverse health events through both surgical interventions and pharmacology; we have become efficient in delivering reactive care (i.e., initiating interventions once an individual is on the verge of or has actually suffered a negative health event). However, with slowly progressing and often ‚Äòsilent‚Äô chronic diseases now being the main cause of illness, healthcare and medicine must evolve into a proactive system, moving away from a merely reactive approach to care. Minimal interactions among the specialists and limited information to the general practitioner and to the individual receiving care lead to a fragmented health approach, non-concerted prescriptions, a scattered follow-up and a suboptimal cost-effectiveness ratio. A new approach in medicine that is predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory, which we label here as ‚ÄúP4‚Äù holds great promise to reduce the burden of chronic diseases by harnessing technology and an increasingly better understanding of environment-biology interactions, evidence-based interventions and the underlying mechanisms of chronic diseases. In this concept paper, we propose a ‚ÄòP4 Health Continuum‚Äô model as a framework to promote and facilitate multi-stakeholder collaboration with an orchestrated common language and an integrated care model to increase the healthspan.},

	abstract = {Background: Regular physical activity has established physical and mental health benefits; however, merely one quarter of the U.S. adult population meets national physical activity recommendations. In an effort to engage individuals who do not meet these guidelines, researchers have utilized popular emerging technologies, including mobile devices (ie, personal digital assistants [PDAs], mobile phones). This study is the first to synthesize current research focused on the use of mobile devices for increasing physical activity. Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis of research utilizing mobile devices to influence physical activity behavior. The aims of this review were to: (1) examine the efficacy of mobile devices in the physical activity setting, (2) explore and discuss implementation of device features across studies, and (3) make recommendations for future intervention development. Methods: We searched electronic databases (PubMed, PsychINFO, SCOPUS) and identified publications through reference lists and requests to experts in the field of mobile health. Studies were included that provided original data and aimed to influence physical activity through dissemination or collection of intervention materials with a mobile device. Data were extracted to calculate effect sizes for individual studies, as were study descriptives. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software suite. Study quality was assessed using the quality of execution portion of the Guide to Community Preventative Services data extraction form. Results: Four studies were of \&\#8220;good\&\#8221; quality and seven of \&\#8220;fair\&\#8221; quality. In total, 1351 individuals participated in 11 unique studies from which 18 effects were extracted and synthesized, yielding an overall weight mean effect size of g = 0.54 (95\% CI = 0.17 to 0.91, P = .01). Conclusions: Research utilizing mobile devices is gaining in popularity, and this study suggests that this platform is an effective means for influencing physical activity behavior. Our focus must be on the best possible use of these tools to measure and understand behavior. Therefore, theoretically grounded behavior change interventions that recognize and act on the potential of smartphone technology could provide investigators with an effective tool for increasing physical activity.},

Consequently, studies on large container ships have been conducted; however, based on the 30,000-TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) class container ship‚Äôs length overall, the deviation of the predicted range showed an 83.9 m difference from 453.0 m to 536.9 m. This is because simple linear regression analysis does not consider trends according to the type of cargo or the size of the cargo. In this study, 5497 container ships up to 20 years of age with an International Maritime Organization (IMO) number registered were clustered according to the change in ship dimensions by k-means clustering algorithm. Based on the clustered data, deadweight tonnage, TEU, length overall, length between perpendiculars, breadth, and maximum draft of container ships with a coverage rate of 75\% were analyzed to predict the change in the main dimensions. The results indicated that for a 30,000-TEU container ship, the predicted length overall is 428.4 m, breadth is 67.6 m, and draft is 17.0 m. This study can help minimize the social costs of designing ports in consideration of future mega-sized container ships.},

	abstract = {In this work, we investigated the accuracy of chronotype estimation from actigraphy while evaluating the required recording length and stability over time. Chronotypes have an important role in chronobiological and sleep research. In outpatient studies, chronotypes are typically evaluated by questionnaires. Alternatively, actigraphy provides potential means for measuring chronotype characteristics objectively, which opens many applications in chronobiology research. However, studies providing objective, critical evaluation of agreement between questionnaire-based and actigraphy-based chronotypes are lacking. We recorded 3-months of actigraphy and collected Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), and Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) results from 122 women. Regression models were applied to evaluate the questionnaire-based chronotypes scores using selected actigraphy features. Changes in predictive strength were evaluated based on actigraphy recordings of different duration. The actigraphy was significantly associated with the questionnaire-based chronotype, and the best single-feature-based models explained 37\% of the variability (R2) for MEQ (p {\textless}¬†.001), 47\% for mid-sleep time MCTQ-MSFsc (p {\textless}¬†.001), and 19\% for social jetlag MCTQ-SJLrel (p {\textless}¬†.001). Concerning stability in time, the Mid-sleep and Acrophase features showed high levels of stability (test-retest R {\textasciitilde}¬†0.8), and actigraphy-based MSFscacti and SJLrelacti showed high temporal variability (test-retest R {\textasciitilde}¬†0.45). Concerning required recording length, features estimated from recordings with 3-week and longer observation periods had sufficient predictive power on unseen data. Additionally, our data showed that the subjectively reported extremes of the MEQ, MCTQ-MSFsc, and MCTQ-SJLrel are commonly overestimated compared to objective activity peak and middle of sleep differences measured by actigraphy. Such difference may be associated with chronotype time-variation. As actigraphy is considered accurate in sleep-wake cycle detection, we conclude that actigraphy-based chronotyping is appropriate for large-scale studies, especially where higher temporal variability in chronotype is expected.},

	abstract = {Actigraphy is the reference objective method to measure circadian rhythmicity. One simpler subjective approach to assess the circadian typology is the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) by Horne and Ostberg. In this study, we compared the MEQ score against the actigraphy-based circadian parameters MESOR, amplitude and acrophase in a sample of 54 students of the University of Milan in Northern Italy. MEQ and the acrophase resulted strongly and inversely associated (r = -0.84, p {\textless} 0.0001), and their relationship exhibited a clear-cut linear trend. We thus used linear regression to develop an equation enabling us to predict the value of the acrophase from the MEQ score. The parameters of the regression model were precisely estimated, with the slope of the regression line being significantly different from 0 (p {\textless} 0.0001). The best-fit linear equation was: acrophase (min) = 1238.7-5.49¬∑MEQ, indicating that each additional point in the MEQ score corresponded to a shortening of the acrophase of approximately 5 min. The coefficient of determination, R2, was 0.70. The residuals were evenly distributed and did not show any systematic pattern, thus indicating that the linear model yielded a good, balanced prediction of the acrophase throughout the range of the MEQ score. In particular, the model was able to accurately predict the mean values of the acrophase in the three chronotypes (Morning-, Neither-, and Evening-types) in which the study subjects were categorized. Both the confidence and prediction limits associated to the regression line were calculated, thus providing an assessment of the uncertainty associated with the prediction of the model. In particular, the size of the two-sided prediction limits for the acrophase was about ¬±100 min in the midrange of the MEQ score. Finally, k-fold cross-validation showed that both the model's predictive ability on new data and the model's stability to changes in the data set used for parameter estimation were good. In conclusion, the actigraphy-based acrophase can be predicted using the MEQ score in a population of college students of North Italy.},

In this regard, circadian rhythm misalignment induced by exposure to night work or long working hours would be responsible for cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, evidence supporting this correlation is limited and several issues still need to be elucidated. In this regard, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the association between shift/night work and cognitive impairment and address its main determinants. Information provided by the reviewed studies suggested that night work might have serious immediate negative effects especially on cognitive domains related to attention, memory and response inhibition. Furthermore, cognitive performance would progressively worsen over consecutive night shifts or following exposure to very long work shifts. Otherwise, conflicting results emerged regarding the possible etiological role that night work chronic exposure would have on cognitive impairment. Therefore, circadian rhythm desynchronization, lack of sleep and fatigue resulting from night work may negatively impact worker‚Äôs cognitive efficiency. However, in light of the considerable methodological variability of the reviewed studies, we proposed to develop a standardized research and evaluation strategy in order to obtain a better and comprehensive understanding of this topic.},

We evaluated three such questionnaires, namely Morningness-Eveningness Stability Scale improved; reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents; and Composite Scale of Morningness in adolescents against actigraphy. Fifty-five¬†healthy 13- to 16-year-old adolescents completed the Morningness-Eveningness Stability Scale improved, reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents, Composite Scale of Morningness, and Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale, and provided a 7-day actigraphy and sleep diary recording about their sleep-wake patterns. We examined the correlations between sleep-wake and activity parameters, and the questionnaires. The influence of age and sex on chronotype classification was studied using uni- and multivariate analyses. All three chronotype questionnaires showed good internal consistency and convergent validity. Spearman correlations reflected less daytime sleepiness, earlier sleep times, midpoints of sleep, and acrophase in morning-oriented participants. Evening-oriented participants had more sleepiness and later respective sleep-wake times. Chronotype classification differed significantly between questionnaires. The Composite Scale of Morningness classified more participants as morning types when compared with the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (12 versus 7, respectively), and fewer adolescents as evening types (5 versus 9, respectively). Age and sex had no significant influence on questionnaire scores. The Morningness-Eveningness Stability Scale improved, reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents, and Composite Scale of Morningness are valid instruments to determine circadian preference in adolescents; however, chronotype classification from the Composite Scale of Morningness and reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents cannot be used interchangeably.},

Various self-report instruments that measure morningness-eveningness have been developed. The aim of this study was to validate seven different self-report measures on morningness-eveningness using actigraphic data. One hundred and sixty-six students (mean age 21.4 years, range 19‚Äì30) were recruited from the University of Bergen and Bergen University College. The participants completed the self-report measures and wore an actigraph for seven days. The results showed that all self-report measures were in concordance with actigraphy-measured bed times, rise times, and the nadir for physical activity. In addition, some of the instruments were sensitive to differences between morning and evening types in their total sleep time on weekend nights or their stability in the activity curve across days as measured by actigraphy. Both the strengths and weaknesses of the present study are discussed, and proposals for future research are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In this first part of this paper, the general principles of circadian biology that underlie clinical evaluation and treatment are reviewed. We then report on the accumulated evidence regarding the evaluation and treatment of shift work disorder (SWD) and jet lag disorder (JLD).
METHODS: A set of specific questions relevant to clinical practice were formulated, a systematic literature search was performed, and relevant articles were abstracted and graded.
RESULTS: A substantial body of literature has accumulated that provides a rational basis the evaluation and treatment of SWD and JLD. Physiological assessment has involved determination of circadian phase using core body temperature and the timing of melatonin secretion. Behavioral assessment has involved sleep logs, actigraphy and the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Treatment interventions fall into three broad categories: 1) prescribed sleep scheduling, 2) circadian phase shifting ("resetting the clock"), and 3) symptomatic treatment using hypnotic and stimulant medications.
CONCLUSION: Circadian rhythm science has also pointed the way to rational interventions for the SWD and JLD, and these treatments have been introduced into the practice of sleep medicine with varying degrees of success. More translational research is needed using subjects who meet current diagnostic criteria.},

Although previous studies described a relationship between the morningness-eveningness trait and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the mechanism underlying this association remains unknown. The study participants comprised 725 Japanese T2DM outpatients free of history of cardiovascular diseases. Various lifestyles were analyzed using self-reported questionnaires, including morningness-eveningness questionnaire (MEQ). The relationships between morningness-eveningness trait and various biochemical parameters were investigated by linear regression analysis and logistic regression analysis. We classified the study patients into three groups, morning type (n=117), neither type (n=424) and evening type (n=184). Subjects of the evening type had high levels of alanine aminotransferase, triglyceride, fasting blood glucose and HbA1c and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level in a model adjusted for age and gender. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that the evening type was associated with high HbA1c and estimated glomerular filtration rate even after adjustment for other lifestyle factors known to affect metabolic control. The results suggest that T2DM patients with eveningness trait are under inadequate metabolic control independent of other lifestyle factors. Thus, the evening trait of T2DM patients represents an important target for intervention to ensure appropriate metabolic function.},

This leads to profound but complex physiological maladaptations in the body commonly referred to as circadian disruption, which recently has been characterized as a carcinogenic factor and reason for poor treatment outcomes, shortened survival, and reduced quality of life in cancer patients. As sleep and circadian physiology in cancer patients spans several disciplines including nursing science, neurology, oncology, molecular biology and medical technology, there is a lack of comprehensive and integrated approaches to deal with this serious and growing issue and at best a fractionated understanding of only part of the problem among researchers within each of these segments. Here, we take a multidisciplinary approach to comprehensively review the diagnosis and impact of sleep and circadian disruption in cancer patients. We discuss recent discoveries on molecular regulation of the circadian clock in healthy and malignant cells, the neurological and endocrine pathways controlling sleep and circadian rhythmicity, and their inputs¬†to and outputs from the organism. The benefits and drawbacks of the various technologies, devices, and instruments used to assess sleep and circadian function, as well as the known consequences of sleep disruption and how sleep can be corrected in cancer patients, will be analyzed. We will throughout the review highlight the extensive crosstalk between sleep, circadian rhythms, and metabolic pathways involved in malignancy and identify current knowledge gaps and barriers for addressing the issue of sleep and circadian disruption in cancer patients. By addressing these issues, we hope to provide a foundation for further research as well as better and more effective care for the patients in the future.},

Chronotype was self-reported in 2009, and 1834 breast cancer cases were confirmed among participants between 1989 and 2007; a 2-yr lag period was imposed to account for possible circadian disruptions related to breast cancer diagnosis. Age- and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Participants who self-reported as neither morning nor evening type had a 27\% increased risk of breast cancer (multivariable-adjusted OR = 1.27, 95\% CI = 1.04‚Äì1.56), compared with definite morning types. None of the other chronotypes were significantly associated with breast cancer risk (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.99, 95\% CI = 0.87‚Äì1.12 for probable morning versus definite morning types; OR = 0.96, 95\% CI = 0.84‚Äì1.09 for probable evening versus definite morning types; and OR = 1.15, 95\% CI = 0.98‚Äì1.34 for definite evening versus definite morning types).

	abstract = {Chronotype reflects time of day preferences for performing daily activities. Previous research within Asian and European cohorts indicates evening chronotype is associated with elevated cardiometabolic risk. However, evidence is limited from population-based US cohorts, particularly among women in whom evening chronotype prevalence may become higher after middle-age, coinciding with life stages associated with higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. This cross-sectional study evaluated associations of chronotype with overall cardiovascular health (CVH), health behaviors, and cardiometabolic risk factors among 506 women (mean age=37¬±16y, 62\% racial/ethnic minority) in the American Heart Association (AHA)‚Äôs Go Red for Women Strategically-Focused Research Network cohort at Columbia University (New York City, NY, USA). Chronotype was assessed using the validated Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and categorized as ‚Äúevening‚Äù, ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù, and ‚Äúmorning‚Äù chronotypes. Health behaviors (diet, physical activity, and sleep) were assessed using validated questionnaires. Anthropometrics, clinical blood pressure, and blood biomarkers were assessed at the clinic visit. CVH was evaluated using the AHA Life‚Äôs Simple 7 (LS7) metrics; LS7 scores of 0‚Äì8 and 9‚Äì14 were considered indicative of poor and moderate-to-high CVH, respectively. Linear and logistic regression models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, education, health insurance, and menopausal status were used to examine associations of MEQ scores and chronotype categories with overall CVH, clinical cardiometabolic risk factors, and health behaviors. Overall, 13\% of women identified as evening chronotypes, while 55\% and 32\% reported being intermediate and morning types. In linear models, higher MEQ scores were associated with higher AHA LS7 scores (Œ≤(SE)=0.02(0.01); p=0.014), indicative of more favorable CVH, and with health behaviors not included in the LS7. Higher MEQ scores were also associated with lower Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, i.e. better sleep quality, (Œ≤(SE)=‚àí0.07(0.02), p{\textless}0.0001), lower insomnia severity (Œ≤(SE)=‚àí0.14(0.01), p{\textless}0.0001), shorter time to fall asleep (Œ≤(SE)=‚àí0.28(0.14), p=0.044), and less sedentary time (Œ≤(SE)=‚àí0.11(0.03), p=0.001). In logistic regression models, evening chronotype, compared to intermediate/morning type, was associated with higher odds of having poor CVH (OR(95\%CI):2.41(1.20‚Äì4.85)), not meeting AHA diet (OR(95\%CI):2.89(1.59‚Äì5.23)) and physical activity guidelines (OR(95\%CI):1.78(1.03‚Äì3.07)), and having short sleep (OR(95\%CI):2.15(1.24‚Äì3.73)) or insomnia (OR(95\%CI):2.69(1.53‚Äì4.75)). The evening type compared to morning type was also associated with being a current smoker (OR(95\%CI):2.14(1.02‚Äì4.52)) and having poor sleep quality (OR(95\%CI:2.35(1.27‚Äì4.37)) and long sleep onset latency (OR(95\%CI:1.89(1.00‚Äì3.56)). In our cohort of women, evening chronotype was related to poor CVH, likely driven by its influence on health behaviors. These findings, although warranting confirmation prospectively in other populations, suggest chronotype is an important factor to consider and possibly target when designing lifestyle interventions for CVD prevention.},

	abstract = {Actigraphy is the reference objective method to measure circadian rhythmicity. One simpler subjective approach to assess the circadian typology is the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) by Horne and Ostberg. In this study, we compared the MEQ score against the actigraphy-based circadian parameters MESOR, amplitude and acrophase in a sample of 54 students of the University of Milan in Northern Italy. MEQ and the acrophase resulted strongly and inversely associated (r = -0.84, p {\textless} 0.0001), and their relationship exhibited a clear-cut linear trend. We thus used linear regression to develop an equation enabling us to predict the value of the acrophase from the MEQ score. The parameters of the regression model were precisely estimated, with the slope of the regression line being significantly different from 0 (p {\textless} 0.0001). The best-fit linear equation was: acrophase (min) = 1238.7-5.49¬∑MEQ, indicating that each additional point in the MEQ score corresponded to a shortening of the acrophase of approximately 5 min. The coefficient of determination, R2, was 0.70. The residuals were evenly distributed and did not show any systematic pattern, thus indicating that the linear model yielded a good, balanced prediction of the acrophase throughout the range of the MEQ score. In particular, the model was able to accurately predict the mean values of the acrophase in the three chronotypes (Morning-, Neither-, and Evening-types) in which the study subjects were categorized. Both the confidence and prediction limits associated to the regression line were calculated, thus providing an assessment of the uncertainty associated with the prediction of the model. In particular, the size of the two-sided prediction limits for the acrophase was about ¬±100 min in the midrange of the MEQ score. Finally, k-fold cross-validation showed that both the model's predictive ability on new data and the model's stability to changes in the data set used for parameter estimation were good. In conclusion, the actigraphy-based acrophase can be predicted using the MEQ score in a population of college students of North Italy.},

	abstract = {Non-traditional machining (NTM) has gained significant attention in the last decade due to its ability to machine conventionally hard-to-machine materials. However, NTMs suffer from several disadvantages such as higher initial cost, lower material removal rate, more power consumption, etc. NTMs involve several process parameters, the appropriate tweaking of which is necessary to obtain economical and suitable results. However, the costly and time-consuming nature of the NTMs makes it a tedious and expensive task to manually investigate the appropriate process parameters. The NTM process parameters and responses are often not linearly related and thus, conventional statistical tools might not be enough to derive functional knowledge. Thus, in this paper, three popular machine learning (ML) methods (viz. linear regression, random forest regression and AdaBoost regression) are employed to develop predictive models for NTM processes. By considering two high-fidelity datasets from the literature on electro-discharge machining and wire electro-discharge machining, case studies are shown in the paper for the effectiveness of the ML methods. Linear regression is observed to be insufficient in accurately mapping the complex relationship between the process parameters and responses. Both random forest regression and AdaBoost regression are found to be suitable for predictive modelling of NTMs. However, AdaBoost regression is recommended as it is found to be insensitive to the number of regressors and thus is more readily deployable.},

	abstract = {The analytic procedures incorporated to facilitate the delivery of projects are often referred to as project analytics. Existing techniques focus on retrospective reporting and understanding the underlying relationships to make informed decisions. Although machine learning algorithms have been widely used in addressing problems within various contexts (e.g., streamlining the design of construction projects), limited studies have evaluated pre-existing machine learning methods within the delivery of construction projects. Due to this, the current research aims to contribute further to this convergence between artificial intelligence and the execution construction project through the evaluation of a specific set of machine learning algorithms. This study proposes a machine learning-based data-driven research framework for addressing problems related to project analytics. It then illustrates an example of the application of this framework. In this illustration, existing data from an open-source data repository on construction projects and cost overrun frequencies was studied in which several machine learning models (Python‚Äôs Scikit-learn package) were tested and evaluated. The data consisted of 44 independent variables (from materials to labour and contracting) and one dependent variable (project cost overrun frequency), which has been categorised for processing under several machine learning models. These models include support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbour, random forest, stacking (ensemble) model and artificial neural network. Feature selection and evaluation methods, including the Univariate feature selection, Recursive feature elimination, SelectFromModel and confusion matrix, were applied to determine the most accurate prediction model. This study also discusses the generalisability of using the proposed research framework in other research contexts within the field of project management. The proposed framework, its illustration in the context of construction projects and its potential to be adopted in different contexts will significantly contribute to project practitioners, stakeholders and academics in addressing many project-related issues.},

	abstract = {Technologies based in robotics and automatics are reshaping the aerospace industry. Aircraft manufacturers and top-tier suppliers now rely on robotics to perform most of its operational tasks. Over the years, a succession of implemented mobile robots has been developed with the mission of automating important industrial processes such as welding, material handling or assembly procedures. However, despite the progress achieved, a major limitation is that the process still requires human supervision and an extensive quality control process. An approach to address this limitation is to integrate machine learning methods within the quality control process. The idea is to develop algorithms that can direct manufacturing experts towards critical areas requiring human supervision and quality control. In this paper we present an application of machine learning to a concrete industrial problem involving the quality control of a riveting machine. The proposal consists of an intelligent predictive model that can be integrated within the existing real time sensing and pre-processing sub-systems at the equipment level. The framework makes use of several data-driven techniques for pre-processing and feature engineering, combined with the most accurate algorithms, validated through k-folds cross validation technique which also estimates prediction errors. The model is able to classify the manufacturing process of the machine as nominal or anomalous according to a real-world data set of design requirements and operational data. Several machine learning algorithms are compared such as linear regression, nearest neighbor, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests and extreme gradient boost. Results obtained from the case study suggest that the proposed model produces accurate predictions which meet industrial standards.},

	abstract = {Background
Circadian rhythms are fundamental to health and are particularly important for mental wellbeing. Disrupted rhythms of rest and activity are recognised as risk factors for major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.

Methods
We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of low relative amplitude (RA), an objective measure of rest-activity cycles derived from the accelerometer data of 71,500 UK Biobank participants. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for low RA were used to investigate potential associations with psychiatric phenotypes.

Outcomes
Two independent genetic loci were associated with low RA, within genomic regions for Neurofascin (NFASC) and Solute Carrier Family 25 Member 17 (SLC25A17). A secondary GWAS of RA as a continuous measure identified a locus within Meis Homeobox 1 (MEIS1). There were no significant genetic correlations between low RA and any of the psychiatric phenotypes assessed. However, PRS for low RA was significantly associated with mood instability across multiple PRS thresholds (at PRS threshold 0¬∑05: OR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1¬∑02, 95\% CI‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1¬∑01‚Äì1¬∑02, p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ9¬∑6‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚àí5), and with major depressive disorder (at PRS threshold 0¬∑1: OR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1¬∑03, 95\% CI‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1¬∑01‚Äì1¬∑05, p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0¬∑025) and neuroticism (at PRS threshold 0¬∑5: Beta‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0¬∑02, 95\% CI‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0¬∑007‚Äì0¬∑04, p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0¬∑021).

Interpretation
Overall, our findings contribute new knowledge on the complex genetic architecture of circadian rhythmicity and suggest a putative biological link between disrupted circadian function and mood disorder phenotypes, particularly mood instability, but also major depressive disorder and neuroticism.

As predicted, the high-vulnerability group recorded a significantly lower 24-hr activity rhythm amplitude than the low-vulnerability group, indicating a less stable activity pattern. Consistent with the notion of accumulating risk, results showed the lowest activity rhythm amplitudes in participants in the high-vulnerability group with a history of depression. Secondary investigations showed that mania proneness explained more variance than depression proneness, pointing to specificity of the findings for BD. The data reinforce claims that instability of daily rhythms is a biomarker of trait vulnerability to BD.},

	abstract = {The lack of exact definition of the concept of biological age (BA) is a typical feature of works concerning BA. That is why comparison of results of various published methods makes little sense and eventual proof of their optimality is impossible. Based on natural and simple presumptions, an attempt to express mathematically the supposed relation between chronological age (CA) and BA has proven to be unexpectedly fruitful. In the present paper, an optimum method of estimation of BA, which is easily applicable even in nonlinear cases, is derived. Moreover, the method allows evaluating the precision of the estimates and also offers tools for validation of presumptions of the method. A special feature of the method is that CA should be used as a standard biomarker, leading to essential improving the precision of BA-estimate and illuminating relativity of the known "paradox of biomarkers". All theoretical results of the method were fully approved by means of a special simulation program. Further, the theory and the results of the simulation have proven that many published results of BA-estimates using multiple linear regression (MLR) are very probably disserviceable because CA is typically more precise estimate of BA than estimates computed by MLR. This unpleasant conclusion also concerns methods, which use MLR as the final step after transformation of the battery of biomarkers by factor analysis or by principal component analysis.},

Animals with mutations in clock genes display accelerated aging and shortened lifespan. Whether impaired rest-activity circadian rhythm is also associated with processes of aging in humans has not been explored. We analyzed accelerometry and physiological data from 7,539 adults participating in the 2011-2014 waves of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). We used accelerometry data to compute rest-activity rhythm measurements. We used physiological data to compute measurements of biological aging according to three published algorithms: Klemera-Doubal method (KDM) Biological Age, PhenoAge, and homeostatic dysregulation (HD). In the models adjusting multiple covariates, participants with higher relative amplitude (RA) and inter-daily stability (IS) and lower intra-daily variability (IV) exhibited less advanced biological aging indexed by KDM and PhenoAge (effect sizes for one-quantile increase in these rest-activity measurements ranged from 0.54-0.57 "years" for RA, 0.24-0.28 "years" for IS and 0.24-0.35 "years" for IV, Ps{\textless}0.001). Similar finding was observed for biological aging indexed by HD, but the significance was limited to relative amplitude with one-quantile increase in relative amplitude associated with 0.09 log units decrease in HD (P{\textless}0.001). The results indicate that blunted rest-activity circadian rhythm is associated with accelerated aging in the general population, suggesting that interventions aiming at enhancing circadian rhythm may be a novel approach for the extension of a healthy life span.},

Advances in the fields of molecular biology have increased the variety of potential candidate biomarkers that may be considered as biological age predictors. In this review, we summarize current state-of-the-art findings considering six potential types of biological age predictors: epigenetic clocks, telomere length, transcriptomic predictors, proteomic predictors, metabolomics-based predictors, and composite biomarker predictors. Promising developments consider multiple combinations of these various types of predictors, which may shed light on the aging process and provide further understanding of what contributes to healthy aging. Thus far, the most promising, new biological age predictor is the epigenetic clock; however its true value as a biomarker of aging requires longitudinal confirmation.},

Harnessing the near limitless capacity of these approaches in the managed healthcare continuum will benefit from a systems-based architecture which presents data quality, quantity, and ease of capture within a decision-making dashboard.
METHODS: A framework was developed which stratifies key components and advances the concept of contextualized biomarkers. The framework codifies how direct, indirect, composite, and contextualized composite data can drive innovation for the application of digital biomarkers in healthcare.
RESULTS: The de novo framework implies consideration of physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors in the context of biomarker capture and analysis. Application in disease and wellness is highlighted, and incorporation in clinical feedback loops and closed-loop systems is illustrated.
CONCLUSIONS: The study of contextualized biomarkers has the potential to offer rich and insightful data for clinical decision making. Moreover, advancement of the field will benefit from innovation at the intersection of medicine, engineering, and science. Technological developments in this dynamic field will thus fuel its logical evolution guided by inputs from patients, physicians, healthcare providers, end-payors, actuarists, medical device manufacturers, and drug companies.},

	abstract = {Using connected sensing devices to remotely monitor health is a promising way to help transition healthcare from a rather reactive to a more precision medicine oriented proactive approach, which could be particularly relevant in the face of rapid population ageing and the challenges it poses to healthcare systems. Sensor derived digital measures of health, such as digital biomarkers or digital clinical outcome assessments, may be used to monitor health status or the risk of adverse events like falls. Current research around such digital measures has largely focused on exploring the use of few individual measures obtained through mobile devices. However, especially for long-term applications in older adults, this choice of technology may not be ideal and could further add to the digital divide. Moreover, large-scale systems biology approaches, like genomics, have already proven beneficial in precision medicine, making it plausible that the same could also hold for remote-health monitoring. In this context, we introduce and describe a zero-interaction digital exhaust: a set of 1268 digital measures that cover large parts of a person‚Äôs activity, behavior and physiology. Making this approach more inclusive of older adults, we base this set entirely on contactless, zero-interaction sensing technologies. Applying the resulting digital exhaust to real-world data, we then demonstrate the possibility to create multiple ageing relevant digital clinical outcome assessments. Paired with modern machine learning, we find these assessments to be surprisingly powerful and often on-par with mobile approaches. Lastly, we highlight the possibility to discover novel digital biomarkers based on this large-scale approach.},

The record life expectancy at birth increased from a level of 44 years in Sweden in 1840 to 82 years in Japan in 2005. The record median age at death shows increasing patterns similar to those observed in life expectancy at birth. However, the record modal age at death changes very little until the second half of the twentieth century: it moved from a plateau level, around age 80, to having a similar pace of increase as that observed for the mean and the median in most recent years. These findings explain the previously observed uninterrupted increase in the record life expectancy. The cause of this increase has changed over time from a dominance of child mortality reductions to a dominance of adult mortality reductions, which became evident by studying trends in the record modal age at death.},

Evidence suggests that ARCI is the consequence of underlying brain pathology. Therefore, efforts to minimize the impact of ARCI and thus closing the gap between health span and life span, which has widened in recent years, requires early detection and timely deployment of targeted, personalized interventions. Access to clinical experts is limited and technology screening and assessment methods are thus appealing. However, as traditionally implemented patients were deprived of the benefit of personalized connection with a clinician, which is particularly critical for the prescription and to ensure the adherence to and ultimate success of therapeutic interventions. We present the concept of Intelligent Technology Therapy Assistant (ITA) as a scalable solution that increases the reach of clinical experts while sustaining the personal connection between each patient and their clinician. We illustrate ITA with the ‚ÄúGuttman Neuro Personal Trainer‚Äù¬Æ, a tele-rehabilitation platform that provides neuropsychological evaluation and care, and the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative (BBHI) multimodal intervention coaching app, a mobile-based platform that provides lifestyle coaching support in domains related to brain health. In addition, we discuss the translation of these models to a large-scale enterprise with Linus Health. To this end, we conclude with a discussion of challenges and opportunities to move the field forward.},

The review coincides with the publication of findings from the large-scale Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiologic (PURE) study (n=130‚Äâ843), which identified a graded lower rate of mortality among those individuals achieving moderate and high levels of PA compared with those with low PA (HR 0.80; 95\%‚ÄâCI 0.74¬†to¬†0.87 and 0.65; 95\%‚ÄâCI 0.60¬†to¬†0.70; P for trend¬†{\textless}0.0001).2 While this study is undeniably an impressive endeavour, collecting prospective data on participants from 17 countries, the conclusion to support increased forms of PA levels for all individuals (irrespective of age, gender or country of origin) has major public health implications. The findings are, as so often, qualified by the study, being unable to fully assert a causal (rather than correlational) role for PA levels in reducing mortality.

Kujala emphasises how epidemiological study designs are vulnerable to limitations that may skew or distort observational associations and impede the distinction between correlation and causation. Such distortions of observed relationships may arise due to confounding by measured/unmeasured lifestyle, behavioural and biological factors (such as higher fitness, lower body mass index (BMI), genetic variation and socioeconomic factors) correlated with both the exposure (here, PA) and outcome (here, longevity). If not appropriately accounted for, confounding factors make the ascertainment of underlying causal mechanisms and pathways exceptionally complex. Such was illustrated by Jerry Morris‚Äô London busmen study revisited by Kujala, where confounding by baseline adiposity biased findings that bus conductors had lower risk of coronary heart disease than their less-active driver counterparts ‚Ä¶},

However, neither randomised controlled trials nor experimental animal studies have provided conclusive evidence to show that physical activity started during adulthood extends lifespan. Consequently, the undisputed health-related benefits of exercise have yet to translate into any proven causal relationship with longevity. Physical activity improves fitness and physical function, and confers other health-related effects.

We also demonstrate five deep biological age estimation models including the proposed approach and compare their performance on the NHANES physical activity dataset. Results on mortality hazard analysis using both the Cox proportional hazard model and Kaplan-Meier curves each show that the proposed method for estimating biological age outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

	abstract = {Age-related physiological changes in humans are linearly associated with age. Naturally, linear combinations of physiological measures trained to estimate chronological age have recently emerged as a practical way to quantify aging in the form of biological age. In this work, we used one-week long physical activity records from a 2003‚Äì2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to compare three increasingly accurate biological age models: the unsupervised Principal Components Analysis (PCA) score, a multivariate linear regression, and a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We found that the supervised approaches produce better chronological age estimations at the expense of a loss of the association between the aging acceleration and all-cause mortality. Consequently, we turned to the NHANES death register directly and introduced a novel way to train parametric proportional hazards models suitable for out-of-the-box implementation with any modern machine learning software. As a demonstration, we produced a separate deep CNN for mortality risks prediction that outperformed any of the biological age or a simple linear proportional hazards model. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the emerging potential of combined wearable sensors and deep learning technologies for applications involving continuous health risk monitoring and real-time feedback to patients and care providers.},

	abstract = {Aging is generally associated with weakening of the circadian system. The circadian amplitude is reduced and the circadian acrophase becomes more labile, tending to occur earlier with advancing age. As originally noted by Franz Halberg, similar features are observed in the experimental laboratory after bilateral lesioning of the suprachiasmatic nuclei, suggesting the involvement of clock genes in the aging process as they are in various disease conditions. Recent work has been shedding light on underlying pathways involved in the aging process, with the promise of interventions to extend healthy life spans. Caloric restriction, which is consistently and reproducibly associated with prolonging life in different animal models, is associated with an increased circadian amplitude. These results indicate the critical importance of chronobiology in dealing with problems of aging, from the circadian clock machinery orchestrating metabolism to the development of geroprotectors. The quantitative estimation of circadian rhythm characteristics interpreted in the light of time-specified reference values helps (1) to distinguish effects of natural healthy aging from those associated with disease and predisease; (2) to detect alterations in rhythm characteristics as markers of increased risk before there is overt disease; and (3) to individually optimize by timing prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring a disturbed circadian system and/or enhancing a healthy life span. Mapping changes in amplitude and/or acrophase that may overshadow any change in average value also avoids drawing spurious conclusions resulting from data collected at a fixed clock hour. Timely risk detection combined with treatment optimization by timing (chronotherapy) is the goal of several ongoing comprehensive community-based studies focusing on the well-being of the elderly, so that longevity is not achieved at the cost of a reduced quality of life.},

These include cerebral activity (sleep-wake cycles), metabolism and energy homeostasis, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, renal activity, and hormone as well as cytokine secretion. The daily rhythms in behaviour and physiology are not just acute responses to timing cues provided by the environment, but are driven by an endogenous circadian timing system. A central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located in the ventral hypothalamus, coordinates all overt rhythms in our body through neuronal and humoral outputs. The SCN consists of two tiny clusters of {\textasciitilde}100,000 neurones in humans, each harbouring a self-sustained, cell-autonomous molecular oscillator. Research conducted during the past years has shown, however, that virtually all of our thirty-five trillion body cells possess their own clocks and that these are indistinguishable from those operative in SCN neurones. Here we give an overview on the molecular and cellular architecture of the mammalian circadian timing system and provide some thoughts on its medical and social impact.},

The widely-used measures based on wearables are epoch-based physical activity counts using accelerometer data. Even though activity counts have been the backbone of thousands of clinical and epidemiological studies, there are large variations of the algorithms that compute counts and their associated parameters‚Äîmany of which have often been kept proprietary by device providers. This lack of transparency has hindered comparability between studies using different devices and limited their broader clinical applicability. ActiGraph devices have been the most-used wearable accelerometer devices for over two decades. Recognizing the importance of data transparency, interpretability and interoperability to both research and clinical use, we here describe the detailed counts algorithms of five generations of ActiGraph devices going back to the first AM7164 model, and publish the current counts algorithm in ActiGraph‚Äôs ActiLife and CentrePoint software as a standalone Python package for research use.

Here, we compared the status of promoter DNA methylation of SF from patients with very early RA with SF from patients with resolving arthritis, fully established RA and from non-arthritic patients. DNA was hybridized to Infinium Human methylation 450k and 850k arrays and differential methylated genes and pathways were identified. We could identify a significant number of CpG sites that differed between the SF of different disease stages, showing that epigenetic changes in SF occur early in RA development. Principal component analysis confirmed that the different groups of SF were separated according to their DNA methylation state. Furthermore, pathway analysis showed that important functional pathways were altered in both very early and late RASF. By focusing our analysis on CpG sites in CpG islands within promoters, we identified genes that have significant hypermethylated promoters in very early RASF. Our data show that changes in DNA methylation differ in RASF compared to other forms of arthritis and occur at a very early, clinically yet unspecific stage of disease. The identified differential methylated genes might become valuable prognostic biomarkers for RA development.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To improve classification of movement behaviours in free-living accelerometer data using machine-learning methods, and to investigate the association between machine-learned movement behaviours and risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults.
METHODS: Using free-living data from 152 participants, we developed a machine-learning model to classify movement behaviours (moderate-to-vigorous physical activity behaviours (MVPA), light physical activity behaviours, sedentary behaviour, sleep) in wrist-worn accelerometer data. Participants in UK Biobank, a prospective cohort, were asked to wear an accelerometer for 7‚Äâdays, and we applied our machine-learning model to classify their movement behaviours. Using compositional data analysis Cox regression, we investigated how reallocating time between movement behaviours was associated with CVD incidence.
RESULTS: In leave-one-participant-out analysis, our machine-learning method classified free-living movement behaviours with mean accuracy 88\% (95\% CI 87\% to 89\%) and Cohen's kappa 0.80 (95\% CI 0.79 to 0.82). Among 87‚Äâ498 UK Biobank participants, there were 4105 incident CVD events. Reallocating time from any behaviour to MVPA, or reallocating time from sedentary behaviour to any behaviour, was associated with lower CVD risk. For an average individual, reallocating 20‚Äâmin/day to MVPA from all other behaviours proportionally was associated with 9\% (95\% CI 7\% to 10\%) lower risk, while reallocating 1‚Äâhour/day to sedentary behaviour from all other behaviours proportionally was associated with 5\% (95\% CI 3\% to 7\%) higher risk.
CONCLUSION: Machine-learning methods classified movement behaviours accurately in free-living accelerometer data. Reallocating time from other behaviours to MVPA, and from sedentary behaviour to other behaviours, was associated with lower risk of incident CVD, and should be promoted by interventions and guidelines.},

Twenty-four adults (33.3\% male; 39.79 ¬± 13.09 years old) simultaneously wore a hip-mounted ActiGraph and thigh-mounted Axivity during 48 consecutive hours. The ActiGraph was switched from hip to wrist during the night. To assess convergent validity between the two devices, Paired sample t-tests, linear regressions, Bland‚ÄìAltman plots and Œ∫ statistic were conducted. Feasibility and acceptability of the devices was self-reported on a five-point scale. Daily time spent in 24-h movement behaviors differed between both devices. Except for sleep, the mean differences in daily time spent in the behaviors were clinically relevant and the limits of agreement were wide. For all 24-h movement behaviors, except for sleep and vigorous physical activity, proportional errors were observed. Œ∫ statistic showed substantial agreement for total physical activity and outstanding agreement for sedentary behavior and sleep. Adults perceived the Axivity as more practical than the ActiGraph to wear it for more than two days whereas the feasibility to wear it for two days was comparable. Depending on the measure, the observed biases were clinically relevant, proportional to the size of the measure and/or erratically variable. When taking into account the data processing approaches applied in this study, the ActiGraph and the Axivity cannot be used interchangeably to measure 24-h movement behaviors since the bias between both devices is clinically relevant and unpredictable.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Accelerometers are commonly used to assess time-use behaviors related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep; however, as new accelerometer technologies emerge, it is important to ensure consistency with previous devices. This study aimed to evaluate the concurrent validity of the commonly used accelerometer, ActiGraph GT3X+, and the relatively new Axivity AX3 (fastened to the lower back) for detecting physical activity intensity and body postures when using direct observation as the criterion measure. Methods: A total of 41 children (aged 6‚Äì16 years) and 33 adults (aged 28‚Äì59 years) wore both monitors concurrently while performing 10 prescribed activities under laboratory conditions. The GT3X+ data were categorized into different physical activity intensity and posture categories using intensity-based cut points and ActiGraph proprietary inclinometer algorithms, respectively. The AX3 data were first converted to ActiGraph counts before being categorized into different physical activity intensity categories, while activity recognition models were used to detect the target postures. Sensitivity, specificity, and the balanced accuracy for intensity and posture category classification were calculated for each accelerometer. Differences in balanced accuracy between the devices and between children and adults were also calculated. Results: Both accelerometers obtained 74‚Äì96\% balanced accuracy, with the AX3 performing slightly better (‚àº4\% higher, p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ.01) for detecting postures and physical activity intensity. Error in both devices was greatest when contrasting sitting/standing, sedentary/light intensity, and moderate/light intensity. Conclusion: In comparison with the GT3X+ accelerometer, AX3 was able to detect various postures and activity intensities with slightly higher balanced accuracy in children and adults.},

	abstract = {Digital health technology tools (DHTT) are technologies such as apps, smartphones, and wearables that remotely acquire health-related information from individuals. They have the potential advantages of objectivity and sensitivity of measurement, richness of high-frequency sensor data, and opportunity for passive collection of health-related data. Thus, DHTTs promise to provide patient phenotyping at an order of granularity several times greater than is possible with traditional clinical research tools. While the conceptual development of novel DHTTs is keeping pace with technological and analytical advancements, an as yet unaddressed gap is how to develop robust and meaningful outcome measures based on sensor data. Here, we describe two roadmaps which were developed to generate outcome measures based on DHTT data: one using a data-centric approach and the second a patient-centric approach. The data-centric approach to develop digital outcome measures summarizes those sensor features maximally sensitive to the concept of interest, exemplified with the quantification of disease progression. The patient-centric approach summarizes those sensor features that are optimally relevant to patients‚Äô functioning in everyday life. Both roadmaps are exemplified for use in tracking disease progression in observational and clinical interventional studies, and with a DHTT designed to evaluate motor symptom severity and symptom experience in Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Use cases other than disease progression (e.g., case-finding) are considered summarily. DHTT research requires methods to summarize sensor data into meaningful outcome measures. It is hoped that the concepts outlined here will encourage a scientific discourse and eventual consensus on the creation of novel digital outcome measures for both basic clinical research and clinical drug development.},

The two principal intervention goals are to induce a mean loss ‚â• 7\% of initial weight and to increase participants‚Äô moderately intense physical activity to ‚â•175 min/wk. For the first 6 months, participants attend one individual and three group sessions per month and are encouraged to replace two meals and one snack a day with liquid shakes and meal bars. From months 7 to 12, they attend one individual and two group meetings per month and continue to replace one meal per day (which is recommended for the study's duration). Starting at month 7, more intensive behavioral interventions and weight loss medication are available from a toolbox, designed to help participants with limited weight loss. In Years 2 to 4, treatment is provided mainly on an individual basis and includes at least one on-site visit per month and a second contact by telephone, mail, or e-mail. After Year 4, participants are offered monthly individual visits.

	abstract = {It is suggested that triaxial accelerometers (RT3) are superior to single-plane accelerometers for predicting energy expenditure (EE).
        Purpose:¬†
        To compare the RT3 uniaxial and triaxial prediction of activity EE (AEE) during treadmill activities (TM) and activities of daily living (ADL).
        Methods:¬†
        Two hundred and twelve subjects (aged 20-60 yr) completed TM speeds of 1.34, 1.56, and 2.23 m¬∑s‚àí1 at 0\% and 3\% grades, stair ascent/descent, moving a box, and two randomly assigned ADL. Subjects wore a portable indirect calorimeter to measure EE to calculate AEE by subtracting resting metabolic rate. Acceleration counts in the vertical (V), medial-lateral, and anterior-posterior planes were collected in a single RT3 secured to the hip. Predicted AEE (RT3AEE) was estimated from vector magnitude (VM) counts using a proprietary algorithm. A paired t-test compared RT3AEE versus AEE. The relationship among V and VM counts and AEE was examined using linear regression analyses.
        Results:¬†
        RT3 overestimated AEE for all activities combined, overestimated for TM (9.0\%), and underestimated for ADL (34.3\%; P {\textless} 0.001). The R2 values between RT3AEE and AEE for TM and ADL were R2 = 0.78 and R2 = 0.15, respectively. The RT3 underestimated activity with greater upper body movements by 24.4\%-64.5\% (P {\textless} 0.001). V and VM counts were similarly related to AEE (R2 = 0.35) and RT3AEE (R2 = 0.83-0.89).
        Conclusions:¬†
        Although the RT3 did not accurately predict AEE from accelerometer counts, stronger relationships existed between predicted and measured AEE for TM compared with ADL. Compared with V counts, using VM counts to predict AEE did not significantly improve the relationship between counts and AEE. Analytic techniques beyond linear regression with VM as a covariate or with counts from each axis entering the model separately may improve estimates of AEE from triaxial accelerometers.},

	abstract = {There is emerging evidence that circadian misalignment may alter energy expenditure, leading to obesity risk among those with irregular schedules [1-5]. It has been reported that energy expenditure is affected by the timing of sleep, exercise, and meals [6]. However, it is unclear whether the circadian system also modulates energy expenditure, independent of behavioral state and food intake. Here, we used a forced desynchrony protocol to examine whether fasted resting energy expenditure (REE) varies with circadian phase in seven participants. This protocol allowed us to uncouple sleep-wake and activity-related effects from the endogenous circadian rhythm, demonstrating that REE varies by circadian phase. REE is lowest at circadian phase ‚àº0¬∞, corresponding to the endogenous core body temperature (CBT) nadir in the late biological night, and highest at circadian phase ‚àº180¬∞ in the biological afternoon and evening. Furthermore, we found that respiratory quotient (RQ), reflecting macronutrient utilization, also varies by circadian phase. RQ is lowest at circadian phase ‚àº240¬∞ and highest at circadian phase ‚àº60¬∞, which corresponds to biological morning. This is the first characterization of a circadian profile in fasted resting energy expenditure and fasted respiratory quotient (with rhythmic profiles in both carbohydrate and lipid oxidation), decoupled from effects of activity, sleep-wake cycle, and diet in humans. The rhythm in energy expenditure and macronutrient metabolism may contribute to greater weight gain in shift workers and others with irregular schedules.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Using wrist-wearable sensors to ecological transient assessment may provide a more valid assessment of physical activity, sedentary time, sleep and circadian rhythm than self-reported questionnaires, but has not been used widely to study the association with mild cognitive impairment and their characteristics.

Methods
31 normal cognitive ability participants and 68 MCI participants were monitored with tri-axial accelerometer and nocturnal photo volumetric pulse wave signals for 14 days. Two machine learning algorithms: gradient boosting decision tree and eXtreme gradient boosting were constructed using data on daytime physical activity, sedentary time and nighttime physiological functions, including heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, combined with subjective scale features. The accuracy, precision, recall, F1 value, and AUC of the different models are compared, and the training and model effectiveness are validated by the subject-based leave-one-out method.

Results
The low physical activity state was higher in the MCI group than in the cognitively normal group between 8:00 and 11:00 (P {\textless} 0.05), the daily rhythm trend of the high physical activity state was generally lower in the MCI group than in the cognitively normal group (P {\textless} 0.05). The peak rhythms in the sedentary state appeared at 12:00‚Äì15:00 and 20:00. The peak rhythms of rMSSD, HRV high frequency output power, and HRV low frequency output power in the 6h HRV parameters at night in the MCI group disappeared at 3:00 a.m., and the amplitude of fluctuations decreased; the amplitude of fluctuations of LHratio nocturnal rhythm increased and the phase was disturbed; the oxygen saturation was between 90 and 95\% and less than 90\% were increased in all time periods (P {\textless} 0.05). The F1 value of the two machine learning algorithms for MCI classification of multi-feature data combined with subjective scales were XGBoost (78.02) and GBDT (84.04).

Conclusion
By collecting PSQI Scale data combined with circadian rhythm characteristics monitored by wrist-wearable sensors, we are able to construct XGBoost and GBDT machine learning models with good discrimination, thus providing an early warning solution for identifying family and community members with high risk of MCI.},

	abstract = {Energy Expenditure (EE) Estimation is an important step in tracking personal activity and preventing chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Accurate and online EE estimation using small wearable sensors is a difficult task, primarily because most existing schemes work offline or using heuristics. In this work, we focus on accurate EE estimation for tracking ambulatory activities (walking, standing, climbing upstairs or downstairs) of individuals wearing mobile sensors. We use Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect important features from data collected from triaxial accelerometer and heart rate sensors. Using CNNs, we find a significant improvement in EE estimation compared to other state-of-the-art models. We compare our results against state-of-the-art Activity-Specific Linear Regression as well as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based models. Using a universal CNN model, we obtain an overall low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.12 which is 30\% and 35\% lower than existing models. The results were calibrated against a COSMED K4b2 indirect calorimeter readings.},

	abstract = {The advent of IoT devices in combination with Human Activity Recognition (HAR) technologies can contribute to battle with sedentariness by continuously monitoring the users' daily activities. With this information, autonomous systems could detect users' physical weaknesses and plan personalized training routines to improve them. This work investigates the multimodal fusion of smartwatch sensor data for HAR. Specifically, we exploit pedometer, heart rate, and accelerometer information to train unimodal and multimodal models for the task at hand. The models are trained end-to-end, and we compare the performance of dedicated Recurrent Neural Network-based (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network-based (CNN) architectures to extract deep learnt representations from the input modalities. To fuse the embedded representations when training the multimodal models, we investigate a concatenation-based and an outer product-based approach. This work explores the harAGE dataset, a new dataset for HAR collected using a Garmin Vivoactive 3 device with more than 17 h of data. Our best models obtain an Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) of 95.6, 69.5, and 60.8\% when tackling the task as a 2-class, 7-class, and 10-class classification problem, respectively. These performances are obtained using multimodal models that fuse the embedded representations extracted with dedicated CNN-based architectures from the pedometer, heart rate, and accelerometer modalities. The concatenation-based fusion scores the highest UAR in the 2-class classification problem, while the outer product-based fusion obtains the best performances in the 7-class and the 10-class classification problems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate measurement of free-living energy expenditure is vital to understanding changes in energy metabolism with aging. The efficacy of heart rate as a surrogate for energy expenditure is rooted in the assumption of a linear function between heart rate and energy expenditure, but its validity and reliability in older adults remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity and reliability of the linear function between heart rate and energy expenditure in older adults using different levels of calibration.
DESIGN: Heart rate and energy expenditure were assessed across five levels of exertion in 290 adults participating in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Correlation and random effects regression analyses assessed the linearity of the relationship between heart rate and energy expenditure and cross-validation models assessed predictive performance.
RESULTS: Heart rate and energy expenditure were highly correlated (r=0.98) and linear regardless of age or sex. Intra-person variability was low but inter-person variability was high, with substantial heterogeneity of the random intercept (s.d.‚Ää=0.372) despite similar slopes. Cross-validation models indicated individual calibration data substantially improves accuracy predictions of energy expenditure from heart rate, reducing the potential for considerable measurement bias. Although using five calibration measures provided the greatest reduction in the standard deviation of prediction errors (1.08 kcals/min), substantial improvement was also noted with two (0.75 kcals/min).
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate standard regression equations may be used to make population-level inferences when estimating energy expenditure from heart rate in older adults but caution should be exercised when making inferences at the individual level without proper calibration.},

Previous attempts to develop aging metrics were hampered by cross-sectional designs and/or focused on younger populations. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), we collected longitudinally across the adult age range a comprehensive list of phenotypes within four domains (body composition, energetics, homeostatic mechanisms and neurodegeneration/neuroplasticity) and functional outcomes. We integrated individual deviations from population trajectories into a global longitudinal phenotypic metric of aging and demonstrate that accelerated longitudinal phenotypic aging is associated with faster physical and cognitive decline, faster accumulation of multimorbidity and shorter survival. These associations are more robust compared with the use of phenotypic and epigenetic measurements at a single time point. Estimation of these metrics required repeated measures of multiple phenotypes over time but may uniquely facilitate the identification of mechanisms driving phenotypic aging and subsequent age-related functional decline.},

However, MET is not an age-equivalent measure of PA intensity, which limits the use of MET-calibrated accelerometers for age-related PA investigations. We investigated calibration using VO2net (VO2gross ‚àí VO2stand; mL‚ãÖmin‚àí1‚ãÖkg‚àí1) as criterion compared to MET (VO2gross/VO2rest) and the effect on assessment of free-living PA in children, adolescents and adults. Oxygen consumption and hip/thigh accelerometer data were collected during rest, stand and treadmill walk and run. Equivalent speed (Speedeq) was used as indicator of the absolute speed (Speedabs) performed with the same effort in individuals of different body size/age. The results showed that VO2net was higher in younger age-groups for Speedabs, but was similar in the three age-groups for Speedeq. MET was lower in younger age-groups for both Speedabs and Speedeq. The same VO2net-values respective MET-values were applied to all age-groups to develop accelerometer PA intensity cut-points. Free-living moderate-and-vigorous PA was 216, 115, 74 and 71 min/d in children, adolescents, younger and older adults with VO2net-calibration, but 140, 83, 74 and 41 min/d with MET-calibration, respectively. In conclusion, VO2net calibration of accelerometers may provide age-equivalent measures of PA intensity/effort for more accurate age-related investigations of PA in epidemiological research.},

wrist acceleration to PAEE in 96,476 UK Biobank participants (mean age 62 years,
56\% female). We also calculated the fraction of PAEE accumulated from
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Over the median 3.1 year
follow-up period (302,526 person-years), 732 deaths were recorded. Higher PAEE
was associated with a lower hazard of all-cause mortality for a constant
fraction of MVPA, e.g. 21\% (95\% CI 4-35\%) lower hazard for 20 versus 15 kJ/kg/d
PAEE with 10\% from MVPA. Similarly, higher MVPA fraction was associated with a
lower hazard when PAEE remained constant, e.g. 30\% (8-47\%) lower hazard when 20\%
versus 10\% of a fixed 15 kJ/kg/d PAEE volume was from MVPA. Our results show
that higher volumes of PAEE are associated with reduced mortality rates, and
achieving the same volume through higher intensity activity is associated with
greater reductions than through lower intensity activity. The linkage of

In this study, we estimated the energy consumption and heart rate in an environment (i.e., running on a treadmill) using smart shoes equipped with triaxial acceleration, triaxial gyroscope, and four-point pressure sensors. The proposed model uses the latest deep learning architecture which does not require any separate preprocessing. Moreover, it is possible to select the optimal sensor using a channel-wise attention mechanism to weigh the sensors depending on their contributions to the estimation of energy expenditure (EE) and heart rate (HR). The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Moreover, the RMSE was 1.05 ¬± 0.15, MAE 0.83 ¬± 0.12 and R2 0.922 ¬± 0.005 in EE estimation. On the other hand, and RMSE was 7.87 ¬± 1.12, MAE 6.21 ¬± 0.86, and R2 0.897 ¬± 0.017 in HR estimation. In both estimations, the most effective sensor was the z axis of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. Through these results, it is demonstrated that the proposed model could contribute to the improvement of the performance of both EE and HR estimations by effectively selecting the optimal sensors during the active movements of participants.},

	abstract = {Physical activity is deemed critical to successful ageing. Despite evidence and progress, there is still a need to determine more precisely the direction, magnitude, intensity, and volume of physical activity that should be performed on a daily basis to effectively promote the health of individuals. This study aimed to assess the clinical validity of new physical activity phenotypes derived from a novel distributional functional analysis of accelerometer data in older adults. A random sample of participants aged between 65 and 80¬†years with valid accelerometer data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011‚Äì2014 was used. Five major clinical phenotypes were identified, which provided a greater sensitivity for predicting 5-year mortality and survival outcomes than age alone, and our results confirm the importance of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The new clinical physical activity phenotypes are a promising tool for improving patient prognosis and for directing to more targeted intervention planning, according to the principles of precision medicine. The use of distributional representations shows clear advantages over more traditional metrics to explore the effects of the full spectrum of the physical activity continuum on human health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research indicates that social isolation and loneliness increase the risk of mental disorders, but less is known about the distinct contributions of different aspects of isolation. We aimed to distinguish the pathways through which social disconnectedness (eg, small social network, infrequent social interaction) and perceptions of social isolation (eg, loneliness, perceived lack of support) contribute to anxiety and depression symptom severity in community-residing older adults aged 57-85 years at baseline.
METHODS: We did a longitudinal mediation analysis with data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). The study included individuals from the USA born between 1920 and 1947. Validated measures on social disconnectedness, perceived isolation, and depression and anxiety symptoms were used. Structural equation modelling was used to construct complete longitudinal path models.
FINDINGS: Using data from 3005 adults aged 57-85 years, we identified two significant longitudinal mediation patterns with symptoms of depression, and two with anxiety symptoms. Overall, social disconnectedness predicted higher subsequent perceived isolation (Œ≤=0¬∑09; p{\textless}0¬∑0001), which in turn predicted higher depression symptoms (Œ≤=0¬∑12; p{\textless}0¬∑0001) and anxiety symptoms (Œ≤=0¬∑12; p{\textless}0¬∑0001). The reverse pathways were statistically supported as well, suggesting bi-directional influences.
INTERPRETATION: Social network structure and function are strongly intertwined with anxiety and depression symptoms in the general population of older adults. Public health initiatives could reduce perceived isolation by facilitating social network integration and participation in community activities, thereby protecting against the development of affective disorders.

	abstract = {Physical activity (PA) is globally recognized as a pillar of general health. Step count, as one measure of PA, is a well known predictor of long-term morbidity and mortality. Despite its popularity in consumer devices, a lack of methodological standards and clinical validation remains a major impediment to step count being accepted as a valid clinical endpoint. Previous works have mainly focused on device-specific step-count algorithms and often employ sensor modalities that may not be widely available. This may limit step-count suitability in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we trained neural network models on publicly available data and tested on an independent cohort using two approaches: generalization and personalization. Specifically, we trained neural networks on accelerometer signals from one device and either directly applied them or adapted them individually to accelerometer data obtained from a separate subject cohort wearing multiple distinct devices. The best models exhibited highly accurate step-count estimates for both the generalization (96‚Äì99\%) and personalization (98‚Äì99\%) approaches. The results demonstrate that it is possible to develop device-agnostic, accelerometer-only algorithms that provide highly accurate step counts, positioning step count as a reliable mobility endpoint and a strong candidate for clinical validation.},

These new approaches also bring the need for several paradigm shifts for PA researchers, including a shift from count-based approaches and regression calibrations for PA energy expenditure (PAEE) estimation to activity characterisation and EE estimation based on features extracted from raw acceleration signals. Furthermore, a collaborative approach towards analytic methods is proposed to facilitate PA research, which requires a shift away from multiple independent calibration studies.

METHOD: The chronic conditions measured in NSHAP Wave 2 were grouped across several health domains: cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic, cancer, lung, inflammatory and bone, neurological, and sensorimotor. Prevalences for each condition were reported as percentages and were also estimated separately by age group and gender. Additionally, 2 comorbidity indices were created: a Modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) that included conditions associated with mortality risk and the NSHAP Comorbidity Index (NCI) that included conditions from the Modified CCI as well as additional conditions related to overall health and function.
RESULTS: Hypertension, incontinence, arthritis, heart conditions, cancer, and diabetes were the most prevalent conditions. In general, prevalences of most chronic conditions increased with age. Additionally, there were several notable gender differences in chronic condition prevalence. Due to the inclusion of highly prevalent conditions, such as hypertension and incontinence, the mean comorbidity index score of the NCI was higher than that of the Modified CCI.
DISCUSSION: Wave 2 of NSHAP included a variety of measures assessing the chronic conditions that are the most prevalent in older adults. These data are a valuable resource for the study of the impact of chronic conditions on overall health and aging.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project is a nationally representative, longitudinal survey of older adults. A main component is the collection of biomeasures to objectively assess physiological status relevant to psychosocial variables, aging conditions, and disease. Wave 2 added novel biomeasures, refined those collected in Wave 1, and provides a reference for the collection protocols and strategy common to the biomeasures. The effects of aging, gender, and their interaction are presented in the specific biomeasure papers included in this Special Issue.
METHOD: A transdisciplinary working group expanded the biomeasures collected to include physiological, genetic, anthropometric, functional, neuropsychological, and sensory measures, yielding 37 more than in Wave 1. All were designed for collection in respondents' homes by nonmedically trained field interviewers.
RESULTS: Both repeated and novel biomeasures were successful. Those in Wave 1 were refined to improve quality, and ensure consistency for longitudinal analysis. Four new biospecimens yielded 27 novel measures. During the interview, 19 biomeasures were recorded covering anthropometric, functional, neuropsychological, and sensory measures and actigraphy provided data on activity and sleep.
DISCUSSION: Improved field methods included in-home collection, temperature control, establishment of a central survey biomeasure laboratory, and shipping, all of which were crucial for successful collection by the field interviewers and accurate laboratory assay of the biomeasures (92.1\% average co-operation rate and 97.3\% average assay success rate). Developed for home interviews, these biomeasures are readily applicable to other surveys.},

The geriatric functional measures and syndromes collected 5 years apart in Waves 1 and 2 of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) data set included: difficulty with activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, the timed up and go, a 3-m timed walk, repeated chair stands, self-reported physical activity, accelerometry-assessed (in)activity, falls, fractures, and frailty. The purpose of this paper was to describe the data collection methods and report preliminary population estimates for each measures.

Method.
Frequencies, means, or medians were estimated for each measure stratified by age and gender, using the age-eligible samples in Wave 1 (n = 3,005) and Wave 2 (n = 3,196). An adapted phenotypic frailty scale was constructed in the sample common to both waves (n = 2,261). Changes over 5 years were reported for four measures common to both waves.

Results.
The functional measures worsened with age (p {\textless} .001). The syndromes were more prevalent with age except ‚Äúall fractures‚Äù (p value range {\textless} .001‚Äì.03). Functional measures were worse among females than males except chair stand performance and the accelerometry-assessed (in)activity measures (p value range {\textless} .001‚Äì.01). The syndromes were more common among females than males except Wave 2 falls and Wave 2 hip fractures (p value range {\textless} .001‚Äì.03). Changes from Wave 1 to 2 revealed 11.5\%‚Äì25.2\% of individuals reported better health and 21.3\%‚Äì44.7\% reported worse health.

Discussion.
The NSHAP provides a comprehensive assessment of geriatric health. Our findings are consistent with the literature and support the construct of the study measures.},

	abstract = {This paper combines causal mediation analysis with double machine learning to control for observed confounders in a data-driven way under a selection-on-observables assumption in a high-dimensional setting. We consider the average indirect effect of a binary treatment operating through an intermediate variable (or mediator) on the causal path between the treatment and the outcome, as well as the unmediated direct effect. Estimation is based on efficient score functions, which possess a multiple robustness property w.r.t. misspecifications of the outcome, mediator, and treatment models. This property is key for selecting these models by double machine learning, which is combined with data splitting to prevent overfitting in the estimation of the effects of interest. We demonstrate that the direct and indirect effect estimators are asymptotically normal and root-n consistent under specific regularity conditions and investigate the finite sample properties of the suggested methods in a simulation study when considering lasso as machine learner. We also provide an empirical application to the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, assessing the indirect effect of health insurance coverage on general health operating via routine checkups as mediator, as well as the direct effect. We find a moderate short term effect of health insurance coverage on general health which is, however, not mediated by routine checkups.},

Separate classifier models forecasted 1-year cognitive decline with over 85\% accuracy using hip data and forecasted 5-year cognitive decline with nearly 70\% accuracy using wrist data, significant improvements compared to demographics and comorbidities alone.

Accelerometers have advanced epidemiologic research on PA by providing objective and continuous measurement of PA in free-living conditions. Wrist-worn accelerometers have become especially popular because of low participant burden. However, the validity and reliability of wrist-worn devices for adults have yet to be summarized. Moreover, accelerometer data provide rich information on how PA is accumulated throughout the day, but only a small portion of these rich data have been used by researchers. Last, new methodological developments are emerging that aim to overcome some of the limitations of accelerometers. In this review, we provide an overview of accelerometry research, with a special focus on wrist-worn accelerometers. We describe briefly how accelerometers work; summarize the validity and reliability of wrist-worn accelerometers; discuss the benefits of accelerometers, including measuring light-intensity PA; and discuss pattern metrics of daily PA recently introduced in the literature. A summary of large-scale cohort studies and randomized trials that implemented wrist-worn accelerometry is provided. We conclude the review by discussing new developments and directions of research using accelerometers, with a focus on wrist-worn accelerometers.},

	abstract = {Background To determine if accelerometer measured sedentary behavior (SED), light-intensity physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) in midlife is prospectively associated with cognitive function. Methods and Results Participants were 1970 adults enrolled in the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study who wore an accelerometer in 2005 to 2006 (ages 38-50¬†years) and had cognitive function assessments completed 5 and/or 10 years later. SED, LPA, and MVPA were measured by an ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer. Cognitive function tests included the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and Stroop Test. Compositional isotemporal substitution analysis examined associations of SED, LPA, and MVPA with repeated measures of the cognitive function standardized scores. In men, statistical reallocation of 30¬†minutes of LPA with 30¬†minutes of MVPA resulted in an estimated difference of SD 0.07 (95\% CI, 0.01-0.14), SD 0.09 (95\% CI, 0.02-0.17), and SD -0.11 (95\% CI, -0.19 to -0.04) in the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and Stroop scores, respectively, indicating better performance. Associations were similar when reallocating time in SED with MVPA, but results were less robust. Reallocation of time in SED with LPA resulted in an estimated difference of SD -0.05 (95\% CI, -0.06 to -0.03), SD -0.03 (95\% CI, -0.05 to -0.01), and SD 0.05 (95\% CI, 0.03- 0.07) in the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and Stroop scores, respectively, indicating worse performance. Associations were largely nonsignificant among women. Conclusions Our findings support the idea that for men, higher-intensity activities (MVPA) may be necessary in midlife to observe beneficial associations with cognition.},

The 78 loci further associate with accelerometer-derived sleep duration, daytime inactivity, sleep efficiency and number of sleep bouts in secondary analysis (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ85,499). Loci are enriched for pathways including striatum and subpallium development, mechanosensory response, dopamine binding, synaptic neurotransmission and plasticity, among others. Genetic correlation indicates shared links with anthropometric, cognitive, metabolic, and psychiatric traits and two-sample Mendelian randomization highlights a bidirectional causal link with schizophrenia.

Greater MVPA was overwhelmingly associated with reduced disease risk (98\% of associations) with hazard ratios (HRs) ranging from 0.10-0.95 per standard deviation (SD) and associations spanning all 18 disease categories tested. A similar pattern of associations was observed when assessing the guideline-based threshold of ‚â•150 MVPA minutes/week. We examined a polygenic risk score for MVPA as an instrumental variable for activity within a separate UK Biobank sample (N=392,058, mean age 57¬±8 years). Greater genetically inferred MVPA was associated with reduced risk of 182 (14\%) incident diseases (HR range 0.74-0.97 per 1 SD), and included strong associations conferring reduced risks of obstructive bronchitis, peripheral vascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and gastritis/duodenitis.

	abstract = {The circadian clock regulates many physiological functions including physical activity and feeding patterns. In addition, scheduled exercise and feeding themselves can affect the circadian clock. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between physical/feeding activity and expression of clock genes in hair follicle cells in older adults. Twenty adult men (age, 68‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ7 years, mean‚Äâ¬±‚ÄâSE) were examined in this cross-sectional study. Prior to hair follicle cell collection, the participants were asked to wear a uniaxial accelerometer for one week. The timings of breakfast, lunch, and dinner were also recorded. Hair follicle cells were then collected over a 24‚Äâh period at 4‚Äâh intervals. The amplitude of PER3 expression was positively correlated with moderate and vigorous physical activity (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.582, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.007) and peak oxygen uptake (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.481, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.032), but these correlations were not observed for NR1D1 or NR1D2. No association was noted between meal times and the amplitude or the acrophase for any of these three clock genes. These findings suggest that rhythmic expression of the circadian clock gene PER3 is associated with the amount of daily physical activity and physical fitness in older adults.},

A connection with sleep disorders, and above all, disorders of the circadian rhythm are the subject of research and debate. The circadian system can be represented on different levels. There have been a variety of studies examining 24-h rhythms at the behavioral and endocrine level. At the molecular level, these rhythms are based on a series of feedback loops of core clock genes and proteins. In this paper, we compared the circadian rhythms at the behavioral, endocrine, and molecular levels between children with ADHD and age- and BMI-matched controls, complementing the previous data in adults. In a minimally invasive setting, sleep was assessed via a questionnaire, actigraphy was used to determine the motor activity and light exposure, saliva samples were taken to assess the 24-h profiles of cortisol and melatonin, and buccal mucosa swaps were taken to assess the expression of the clock genes BMAL1 and PER2. We found significant group differences in sleep onset and sleep duration, cortisol secretion profiles, and in the expression of both clock genes. Our data suggest that the analysis of circadian molecular rhythms may provide a new approach for diagnosing ADHD in children and adults.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circadian rhythms are fundamental to health and are particularly important for mental wellbeing. Disrupted rhythms of rest and activity are recognised as risk factors for major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.
METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of low relative amplitude (RA), an objective measure of rest-activity cycles derived from the accelerometer data of 71,500 UK Biobank participants. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for low RA were used to investigate potential associations with psychiatric phenotypes.
OUTCOMES: Two independent genetic loci were associated with low RA, within genomic regions for Neurofascin (NFASC) and Solute Carrier Family 25 Member 17 (SLC25A17). A secondary GWAS of RA as a continuous measure identified a locus within Meis Homeobox 1 (MEIS1). There were no significant genetic correlations between low RA and any of the psychiatric phenotypes assessed. However, PRS for low RA was significantly associated with mood instability across multiple PRS thresholds (at PRS threshold 0¬∑05: OR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1¬∑02, 95\% CI‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1¬∑01-1¬∑02, p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ9¬∑6‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10-5), and with major depressive disorder (at PRS threshold 0¬∑1: OR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1¬∑03, 95\% CI‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1¬∑01-1¬∑05, p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0¬∑025) and neuroticism (at PRS threshold 0¬∑5: Beta‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0¬∑02, 95\% CI‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0¬∑007-0¬∑04, p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0¬∑021).
INTERPRETATION: Overall, our findings contribute new knowledge on the complex genetic architecture of circadian rhythmicity and suggest a putative biological link between disrupted circadian function and mood disorder phenotypes, particularly mood instability, but also major depressive disorder and neuroticism.

Correlation with biomarkers is often used to assess the relative validity of these different approaches, however, validated biomarkers do not always exist and are costly and laborious to collect. We present a novel high-throughput approach which utilizes the modest but importantly non-zero influence of genetic variation on variation in dietary intake to compare different statistical transformations of dietary variables. Specifically, we compare the heritability of crude averages with Empirical Bayes weighted averages for 302 correlated dietary variables from multiple 24-hour recall questionnaires in 177¬†K individuals in UK Biobank. Overall, the crude averages for frequency of consumption are more heritable than their Empirical Bayes counterparts only when the reliability of that item across questionnaires is high (measured by intra-class correlation), otherwise, the Empirical Bayes approach (for both unreliably measured frequencies and for average quantities independent of reliability) leads to higher heritability estimates. We also find that the more heritable versions of each dietary variable lead to stronger underlying statistical associations with specific genetic loci, many of which have well-known mechanisms, further supporting heritability as an alternative metric for relative validity in nutritional epidemiology and beyond.},

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS), based on self-reported data or a small number of phenotypes derived from accelerometry, have identified a limited number of genetic loci associated with habitual PA and provided evidence for involvement of central nervous system in mediating genetic effects. In this study, we derived 27 PA phenotypes from wrist accelerometry data obtained from 88,411 UK Biobank study participants. Single-variant association analysis based on mixed-effects models and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) together identified 5 novel loci that were not detected by previous studies of PA, sleep duration and self-reported chronotype. For both novel and previously known loci, we discovered associations with novel phenotypes including active-to-sedentary transition probability, light-intensity PA, activity during different times of the day and proxy phenotypes to sleep and circadian patterns. Follow-up studies including TWAS, colocalization, tissue-specific heritability enrichment, gene-set enrichment and genetic correlation analyses indicated the role of the blood and immune system in modulating the genetic effects and a secondary role of the digestive and endocrine systems. Our findings provided important insights into the genetic architecture of PA and its underlying mechanisms.},

We identify 12 new genetic loci that implicate known components of the circadian clock machinery and point to previously unstudied genetic variants and candidate genes that might modulate core circadian rhythms or light-sensing pathways. Pathway analyses highlight central nervous and ocular systems and fear-response-related processes. Genetic correlation analysis suggests chronotype shares underlying genetic pathways with schizophrenia, educational attainment and possibly BMI. Further, Mendelian randomization suggests that evening chronotype relates to higher educational attainment. These results not only expand our knowledge of the circadian system in humans but also expose the influence of circadian characteristics over human health and life-history variables such as educational attainment.},

The objective of the Levodopa Response Study was to identify whether wearable sensor data can be used to objectively quantify symptom severity in individuals with PD exhibiting motor fluctuations. Thirty-one subjects with PD were recruited from 2 sites to participate in a 4-day study. Data was collected using 2 wrist-worn accelerometers and a waist-worn smartphone. During Days 1 and 4, a portion of the data was collected in the laboratory while subjects performed a battery of motor tasks as clinicians rated symptom severity. The remaining of the recordings were performed in the home and community settings.

	abstract = {Most wearable sensor studies in Parkinson‚Äôs disease have been conducted in the clinic and thus may not be a true representation of everyday symptoms and symptom variation. Our goal was to measure activity, gait, and tremor using wearable sensors inside and outside the clinic. In this observational study, we assessed motor features using wearable sensors developed by MC10, Inc. Participants wore five sensors, one on each limb and on the trunk, during an in-person clinic visit and for two days thereafter. Using the accelerometer data from the sensors, activity states (lying, sitting, standing, walking) were determined and steps per day were also computed by aggregating over 2‚Äâs walking intervals. For non-walking periods, tremor durations were identified that had a characteristic frequency between 3 and 10‚ÄâHz. We analyzed data from 17 individuals with Parkinson‚Äôs disease and 17 age-matched controls over an average 45.4‚Äâh of sensor wear. Individuals with Parkinson‚Äôs walked significantly less (median [inter-quartile range]: 4980 [2835‚Äì7163] steps/day) than controls (7367 [5106‚Äì8928] steps/day; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.04).

Thus, the chances of misdiagnosis are high. Researchers employed machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately classify ET and PSD patients. This requires manual feature extraction that, without knowing their importance in prediction purposes, can be mitigated with automated feature engineering using deep learning (DL). So, in this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classification model with seven hidden layers and different filter sizes for the accurate classification of PSD and healthy control (HC) subjects. A flatten layer converts three-dimensional data to one-dimensional Tensor flow. Finally, the dense layer outputs the classification of PSD and HC patients based on tremor intensity to identify the PSD patient‚Äôs risk at an early stage. It outperforms the traditional models with 92.4\% accuracy of tremor classification.},

We build upon previous work to deliver multimodal predictions of Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) risk and systematically develop a model using GenoML, an automated ML package, to make improved multi-omic predictions of PD, validated in an external cohort. We investigated top features, constructed hypothesis-free disease-relevant networks, and investigated drug‚Äìgene interactions. We performed automated ML on multimodal data from the Parkinson‚Äôs progression marker initiative (PPMI). After selecting the best performing algorithm, all PPMI data was used to tune the selected model. The model was validated in the Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) dataset. Our initial model showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 89.72\% for the diagnosis of PD. The tuned model was then tested for validation on external data (PDBP, AUC 85.03\%). Optimizing thresholds for classification increased the diagnosis prediction accuracy and other metrics. Finally, networks were built to identify gene communities specific to PD. Combining data modalities outperforms the single biomarker paradigm. UPSIT and PRS contributed most to the predictive power of the model, but the accuracy of these are supplemented by many smaller effect transcripts and risk SNPs. Our model is best suited to identifying large groups of individuals to monitor within a health registry or biobank to prioritize for further testing. This approach allows complex predictive models to be reproducible and accessible to the community, with the package, code, and results publicly available.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) is a shared characteristic of various brain disorders, such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD), and major depression disorder (MDD). Disruption of circadian rhythm might be a risk factor for brain disorder incidents. From 7-day accelerometry data of 72,242 participants in UK Biobank, we derived a circadian relative amplitude variable, which to some extent reflected the degree of circadian rhythm disruption. Records of brain disorder incidents were obtained from a wide range of health outcomes across self-report, primary care, hospital inpatient data, and death data. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio regression, we created two models adjusting for different covariates. Then, linear correlations between relative amplitude and several brain morphometric measures were examined in participants with brain MRI data. After a median follow-up of around 6.1 years, 72,242 participants were included in the current study (female 54.9\%; mean age 62.1 years). Individuals with reduced relative amplitude had increasing risk of all-cause dementia (Hazard ratio 1.23 [95\% CI 1.15 to 1.31]), PD (1.33 [1.25 to 1.41]), stroke (1.13 [1.06 to 1.22]), MDD (1.18 [1.13 to 1.23]), and anxiety disorder (1.14 [1.09 to 1.20]) in fully adjusted models. Additionally, significant correlations were found between several cortical regions and white matter tracts and relative amplitude that have been linked to dementia and psychiatric disorders. We confirm CRD to be a risk factor for various brain disorders. Interventions for regulating circadian rhythm may have clinical relevance to reducing the risk of various brain disorders.},

	abstract = {Parkinson‚Äôs Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting more than 1\% of the population above 60 years old with both motor and non-motor symptoms of escalating severity as it progresses. Since it cannot be cured, treatment options focus on the improvement of PD symptoms. In fact, evidence suggests that early PD intervention has the potential to slow down symptom progression and improve the general quality of life in the long term. However, the initial motor symptoms are usually very subtle and, as a result, patients seek medical assistance only when their condition has substantially deteriorated; thus, missing the opportunity for an improved clinical outcome. This situation highlights the need for accessible tools that can screen for early motor PD symptoms and alert individuals to act accordingly. Here we show that PD and its motor symptoms can unobtrusively be detected from the combination of accelerometer and touchscreen typing data that are passively captured during natural user-smartphone interaction. To this end, we introduce a deep learning framework that analyses such data to simultaneously predict tremor, fine-motor impairment and PD. In a validation dataset from 22 clinically-assessed subjects (8 Healthy Controls (HC)/14 PD patients with a total data contribution of 18.305 accelerometer and 2.922 typing sessions), the proposed approach achieved 0.86/0.93 sensitivity/specificity for the binary classification task of HC versus PD. Additional validation on data from 157 subjects (131 HC/26 PD with a total contribution of 76.528 accelerometer and 18.069 typing sessions) with self-reported health status (HC or PD), resulted in area under curve of 0.87, with sensitivity/specificity of 0.92/0.69 and 0.60/0.92 at the operating points of highest sensitivity or specificity, respectively. Our findings suggest that the proposed method can be used as a stepping stone towards the development of an accessible PD screening tool that will passively monitor the subject-smartphone interaction for signs of PD and which could be used to reduce the critical gap between disease onset and start of treatment.},

	abstract = {People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) are associated with the presence of periodontitis. We aimed to compare blood and standard biochemical surrogates of PD patients diagnosed with periodontitis with PD individuals without periodontitis. This retrospective cohort study used a sample from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2012 that underwent periodontal diagnosis (n = 3669). PD participants were identified through specific PD reported medications. Periodontitis was defined according to the 2012 case definition, using periodontal examination data provided. Then, we compared blood levels and standard chemical laboratory profiles of PD patients according to the presence of periodontitis. Multivariable regression was used to explore this dataset and identify relevant variables towards the presence of periodontitis. According to the medication report, 37 participants were eligible, 29 were secure and 8 were unsecure PD medications regimens. Overall, PD cases with periodontitis presented increased levels of White Blood Cells (WBC) (p = 0.002), Basophils (p = 0.045) and Segmented neutrophils (p = 0.009), and also, lower levels of Total Bilirubin (p = 0.018). In the PD secure medication group, a significant difference was found for WBC (p = 0.002) and Segmented neutrophils (p = 0.002) for the periodontitis group. Further, WBC might be a discriminating factor towards periodontitis in the global sample. In the secure PD medication, we found gender, segmented neutrophils and Vitamin D2 to be potential discriminative variables towards periodontitis. Thus, periodontitis showed association with leukocyte levels alterations in PD patients, and therefore with potential systemic changes and predictive value. Furthermore, Vitamin D2 and gender showed to be associated with periodontitis in with secure medication for PD. Future studies should assess in more detail the potential systemic repercussion of the presence of periodontitis in PD patients.},

The ubiquity of wrist-worn accelerometry suggests a possible sensor modality for early detection of PD symptoms and subsequent tracking of PD symptom severity. As an initial proof of concept for this technological approach, we analyzed the U.K. Biobank data set, consisting of one week of wrist-worn accelerometry from a population with a PD primary diagnosis and an age-matched healthy control population. Measures of movement dispersion were extracted from automatically segmented gait data, and measures of movement dimensionality were extracted from automatically segmented low-movement data. Using machine learning classifiers applied to one week of data, PD was detected with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.69 on gait data, AUC = 0.84 on low-movement data, and AUC = 0.85 on a fusion of both activities. It was also found that classification accuracy steadily improved across the one-week data collection, suggesting that higher accuracy could be achievable from a longer data collection. These results suggest the viability of using a low-cost and easy-to-use activity sensor for detecting movement abnormalities due to PD and motivate further research on early PD detection and tracking of PD symptom severity.},

	abstract = {Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) is associated with several non-motor symptoms that may precede the diagnosis and constitute a major source of frailty in this population. The digital era in health care has open up new prospects to move forward from the qualitative and subjective scoring for PD with the use of new wearable biosensors that enable frequent quantitative, reliable, repeatable, and multidimensional measurements to be made with minimal discomfort and inconvenience for patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted to test a wrist-worn device combined with machine-learning processing to detect circadian rhythms of sleep, motor, and autonomic disruption, which can be suitable for the objective and non-invasive evaluation of PD patients. Wrist skin temperature, motor acceleration, time in movement, hand position, light exposure, and sleep rhythms were continuously measured in 12 PD patients and 12 age-matched healthy controls for seven consecutive days using an ambulatory circadian monitoring device (ACM). Our study demonstrates that a multichannel ACM device collects reliable and complementary information from motor (acceleration and time in movement) and common non-motor (sleep and skin temperature rhythms) features frequently disrupted in PD. Acceleration during the daytime (as indicative of motor impairment), time in movement during sleep (representative of fragmented sleep) and their ratio (A/T) are the best indexes to objectively characterize the most common symptoms of PD, allowing for a reliable and easy scoring method to evaluate patients. Chronodisruption score, measured by the integrative algorithm known as the circadian function index is directly linked to a low A/T score. Our work attempts to implement innovative technologies based on wearable, multisensor, objective, and easy-to-use devices, to quantify PD circadian rhythms in huge populations over extended periods of time, while controlling at the same time exposure to exogenous circadian synchronizers.},

	abstract = {Rice yield per plant has a complex genetic architecture, which is mainly determined by its three component traits: the number of grains per panicle (GPP), kilo-grain weight (KGW), and tillers per plant (TP). Exploring ideotype breeding based on selection for genetically less complex component traits is an alternative route for further improving rice production. To understand the genetic basis of the relationship between rice yield and component traits, we investigated the four traits of two rice hybrid populations (575‚Äâ+‚Äâ1495 F1) in different environments and conducted meta-analyses of genome-wide association study (meta-GWAS). In total, 3589 significant loci for three components traits were detected, while only 3 loci for yield were detected. It indicated that rice yield is mainly controlled by minor-effect loci and hardly to be identified. Selecting quantitative trait locus/gene affected component traits to further enhance yield is recommended. Mendelian randomization design is adopted to investigate the genetic effects of loci on yield through component traits and estimate the genetic relationship between rice yield and its component traits by these loci. The loci for GPP or TP mainly had a positive genetic effect on yield, but the loci for KGW with different direction effects (positive effect or negative effect). Additionally, TP (Beta‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.865) has a greater effect on yield than KGW (Beta‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.016) and GPP (Beta‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.086). Five significant loci for component traits that had an indirect effect on yield were identified. Pyramiding superior alleles of the five loci revealed improved yield. A combination of direct and indirect effects may better contribute to the yield potential of rice. Our findings provided a rationale for using component traits as indirect indices to enhanced rice yield, which will be helpful for further understanding the genetic basis of yield and provide valuable information for improving rice yield potential.},

	abstract = {Background:. Epigenetic clocks have been associated with cancer risk in several observational studies. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether they play a causal role in cancer risk or if they act as a non-causal biomarker. Methods:. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to examine the genetically predicted effects of epigenetic age acceleration as measured by HannumAge (nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), Horvath Intrinsic Age (24 SNPs), PhenoAge (11 SNPs), and GrimAge (4 SNPs) on multiple cancers (i.e. breast, prostate, colorectal, ovarian and lung cancer). We obtained genome-wide association data for biological ageing from a meta-analysis (N = 34,710), and for cancer from the UK Biobank (N cases = 2671‚Äì13,879; N controls = 173,493‚Äì372,016), FinnGen (N cases = 719‚Äì8401; N controls = 74,685‚Äì174,006) and several international cancer genetic consortia (N cases = 11,348‚Äì122,977; N controls = 15,861‚Äì105,974). Main analyses were performed using multiplicative random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR. Individual study estimates were pooled using fixed effect meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses included MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode and Causal Analysis using Summary Effect Estimates (CAUSE) methods, which are robust to some of the assumptions of the IVW approach. Results:. Meta-analysed IVW MR findings suggested that higher GrimAge acceleration increased the risk of colorectal cancer (OR = 1.12 per year increase in GrimAge acceleration, 95\% CI 1.04‚Äì1.20, p = 0.002). The direction of the genetically predicted effects was consistent across main and sensitivity MR analyses. Among subtypes, the genetically predicted effect of GrimAge acceleration was greater for colon cancer (IVW OR = 1.15, 95\% CI 1.09‚Äì1.21, p = 0.006), than rectal cancer (IVW OR = 1.05, 95\% CI 0.97‚Äì1.13, p = 0.24). Results were less consistent for associations between other epigenetic clocks and cancers. Conclusions:. GrimAge acceleration may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Findings for other clocks and cancers were inconsistent. Further work is required to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the results. Funding:.

While the first generation of epigenetic biomarkers of aging were developed using chronological age as a surrogate for biological age, we hypothesized that incorporation of composite clinical measures of phenotypic age that capture differences in lifespan and healthspan may identify novel CpGs and facilitate the development of a more powerful epigenetic biomarker of aging. Using an innovative two-step process, we develop a new epigenetic biomarker of aging, DNAm PhenoAge, that strongly outperforms previous measures in regards to predictions for a variety of aging outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cancers, healthspan, physical functioning, and Alzheimer's disease. While this biomarker was developed using data from whole blood, it correlates strongly with age in every tissue and cell tested. Based on an in-depth transcriptional analysis in sorted cells, we find that increased epigenetic, relative to chronological age, is associated with increased activation of pro-inflammatory and interferon pathways, and decreased activation of transcriptional/translational machinery, DNA damage response, and mitochondrial signatures. Overall, this single epigenetic biomarker of aging is able to capture risks for an array of diverse outcomes across multiple tissues and cells, and provide insight into important pathways in aging.},

	abstract = {There is no single universal biomarker yet to estimate overall health status and longevity prospects. Moreover, a consensual approach to the very concept of aging and the means of its assessment are yet to be developed. Markers of aging could facilitate effective health control, more accurate life expectancy estimates, and improved health and quality of life. Clinicians routinely use several indicators that could be biomarkers of aging. Duly validated in a large cohort, models based on a combination of these markers could provide a highly accurate assessment of biological age and the pace of aging. Biological aging is a complex characteristic of chronological age (usually), health-to-age concordance, and medically estimated life expectancy. This study is a review of the most promising techniques that could soon be used in routine clinical practice. Two main selection criteria were applied: a sufficient sample size and reliability based on validation. The selected biological age calculators were grouped according to the type of biomarker used: (1) standard clinical and laboratory markers; (2) molecular markers; and (3) epigenetic markers. The most accurate were the calculators, which factored in a variety of biomarkers. Despite their demonstrated effectiveness, most of them require further improvement and cannot yet be considered for use in standard clinical practice. To illustrate their clinical application, we reviewed their use during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

One factor that could accelerate biological aging in women is reproduction. Pregnancy is characterized by extensive, energetically-costly changes across numerous physiological systems. These ‚Äòcosts of reproduction‚Äô may accumulate with each pregnancy, accelerating biological aging. Despite evidence for costs of reproduction using molecular and demographic measures, it is unknown whether parity is linked to commonly-used clinical measures of biological aging. We use data collected between 1999 and 2010 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ4418) to test whether parity (number of live births) predicted four previously-validated composite measures of biological age and system integrity: Levine Method, homeostatic dysregulation, Klemera‚ÄìDoubal method biological age, and allostatic load. Parity exhibited a U-shaped relationship with accelerated biological aging when controlling for chronological age, lifestyle, health-related, and demographic factors in post-menopausal, but not pre-menopausal, women, with biological age acceleration being lowest among post-menopausal women reporting between three¬†and four live births. Our findings suggest a link between reproductive function and physiological dysregulation, and allude to possible¬†compensatory mechanisms that buffer the effects of reproductive function on physiological dysregulation during a woman‚Äôs reproductive lifespan.

	abstract = {Background
Chronological age is the strongest risk factor for most chronic diseases. Developing a biomarker-based age and understanding its most important contributing biomarkers may shed light on the effects of age on later-life health and inform opportunities for disease prevention.

Methods
A subpopulation of 141 254 individuals healthy at baseline were studied, from among 480 019 UK Biobank participants aged 40‚Äì70 recruited in 2006‚Äì2010, and followed up for 6‚Äì12 years via linked death and secondary care records. Principal components of 72 biomarkers measured at baseline were characterized and used to construct sex-specific composite biomarker ages using the Klemera Doubal method, which derived a weighted sum of biomarker principal components based on their linear associations with chronological age. Biomarker importance in the biomarker ages was assessed by the proportion of the variation in the biomarker ages that each explained. The proportions of the overall biomarker and chronological age effects on mortality and age-related hospital admissions explained by the biomarker ages were compared using likelihoods in Cox proportional hazard models.

Results
Reduced lung function, kidney function, reaction time, insulin-like growth factor 1, hand grip strength, and higher blood pressure were key contributors to the derived biomarker age in both men and women. The biomarker ages accounted for {\textgreater}65\% and {\textgreater}84\% of the apparent effect of age on mortality and hospital admissions for the healthy and whole populations, respectively, and significantly improved prediction of mortality (p {\textless} .001) and hospital admissions (p {\textless} 1 √ó 10‚àí10) over chronological age alone.

Conclusions
This study suggests that a broader, multisystem approach to research and prevention of diseases of aging warrants consideration.},

Prediction of age was an important first step, but‚Äîin our view‚Äîthe focus must shift from chasing increasingly accurate age computations to understanding the links between the epigenome and the mechanisms and physiological changes of aging. Here, we outline emerging areas of epigenetic aging research that prioritize biological understanding and clinical application. First, we survey recent progress in epigenetic clocks, which are beginning to predict not only chronological age but aging outcomes such as all-cause mortality and onset of disease, or which integrate aging signals across multiple biological processes. Second, we discuss research that exemplifies how investigation of the epigenome is building a mechanistic theory of aging and informing clinical practice. Such examples include identifying methylation sites and the genes most strongly predictive of aging‚Äîa subset of which have shown strong potential as biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease and cancer; relating epigenetic clock predictions to hallmarks of aging; and using longitudinal studies of DNA methylation to characterize human disease, resulting in the discovery of epigenetic indications of type 1 diabetes and the propensity for psychotic experiences.},

	abstract = {DNA methylation age (DNAm age) has become a widely utilized epigenetic biomarker for the aging process. The Horvath method for determining DNAm age is perhaps the most widely utilized and validated DNA methylation age assessment measure. Horvath DNAm age is calculated based on methylation measurements at 353 loci, present on Illumina's 450k and 27k DNA methylation microarrays. With increasing use of the more recently developed Illumina MethylationEPIC (850k) microarray, it is worth revisiting this aging measure to evaluate estimation differences due to array design. Of the requisite 353 loci, 17 are missing from the 850k microarray. Similarly, an alternate, 71 loci DNA methylation age assessment measure created by Hannum et al. is missing 6 requisite loci. Using 17 datasets with 27k, 450k, and/or 850k methylation data, we compared each sample's epigenetic age estimated from all 353 loci required by the Horvath DNAm age calculator, and using only the 336 loci available on the 850k array. In 450k/27k data, removing loci not on the 850k array resulted in underestimation of Horvath's DNAm age. Underestimation of Horvath DNAm age increased from ages 0 to {\textasciitilde}20, remaining stable thereafter (mean deviation = -3.46 y, SD = 1.13 for individuals ‚â•20 years). Underestimation of Horvath's DNAm age by the reduced 450k/27k data was similar to the underestimation observed in the 850k data indicating it is driven by missing probes. In analogous examination of Hannum's DNAm age, the magnitude and direction of epigenetic age misestimation varied with chronological age. In conclusion, inter-array deviations in DNAm age estimations may be largely driven by missing probes between arrays, despite default probe imputation procedures. Though correlations and associations based on Horvath's DNAm age may be unaffected, researchers should exercise caution when interpreting results based on absolute differences in DNAm age or when mixing samples assayed on different arrays.},

Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted on saliva samples using the Illumina Methylation Epic Array and DNAmAge was calculated using the online Horvath DNAmAge clock (2013). The diet and lifestyle treatment was associated with a 3.23 years decrease in DNAmAge compared with controls (p=0.018). DNAmAge of those in the treatment group decreased by an average 1.96 years by the end of the program compared to the same individuals at the beginning with a strong trend towards significance (p=0.066). Changes in blood biomarkers were significant for mean serum 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (+15\%, p=0.004) and mean triglycerides (-25\%, p=0.009). To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled study to suggest that specific diet and lifestyle interventions may reverse Horvath DNAmAge (2013) epigenetic aging in healthy adult males.

Objective information regarding the best-suited methodology for a specific research question is scant. Therefore, we performed a large-scale evaluation on a set of 70 brain tissue samples, i.e. 65 glioblastoma and 5 non-tumoral tissues. As MethylCap-seq coverages were limited, we focused on the inherent capacity of the methodology to detect methylated loci rather than a quantitative analysis. MethylCap-seq and HM450 data were dichotomized and performances were compared using a gold standard free Bayesian modelling procedure. While conditional specificity was adequate for both approaches, conditional sensitivity was systematically higher for HM450. In addition, genome-wide characteristics were compared, revealing that HM450 probes identified substantially fewer regions compared to MethylCap-seq. Although results indicated that the latter method can detect more potentially relevant DNA-methylation, this did not translate into the discovery of more differentially methylated loci between tumours and controls compared to HM450. Our results therefore indicate that both methodologies are complementary, with a higher sensitivity for HM450 and a far larger genome-wide coverage for MethylCap-seq, but also that a more comprehensive character does not automatically imply more significant results in biomarker studies.},

Naturally, linear combinations of physiological measures trained to estimate chronological age have recently emerged as a practical way to quantify aging in the form of biological age. In this work, we used one-week long physical activity records from a 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to compare three increasingly accurate biological age models: the unsupervised Principal Components Analysis (PCA) score, a multivariate linear regression, and a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We found that the supervised approaches produce better chronological age estimations at the expense of a loss of the association between the aging acceleration and all-cause mortality. Consequently, we turned to the NHANES death register directly and introduced a novel way to train parametric proportional hazards models suitable for out-of-the-box implementation with any modern machine learning software. As a demonstration, we produced a separate deep CNN for mortality risks prediction that outperformed any of the biological age or a simple linear proportional hazards model. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the emerging potential of combined wearable sensors and deep learning technologies for applications involving continuous health risk monitoring and real-time feedback to patients and care providers.},

	abstract = {Back pain is a problem that affects at least 90\% of the human population during their lifetimes, and it is one of the main causes of absence from work. Despite the large number of medical cases, there is insufficient research in this field, due in part to the necessity of administering multiple medical exams to patients with vertebral problems for accurate diagnosis. In addition, the cause of back pain may be benign, and heal without treatment. In this study, two artificial intelligence algorithms were employed to classify patients with spinal problems. The algorithms used were K-means and Self Organizing Maps (SOM). With these techniques, two models were obtained that provided a generalization error of less than 10\%. The models were compared based on metrics that enable the measurement of classifier performance, including the sensitivity, specificity, precision, and negative predictive value (NPV), as well as Cohen's Kappa index to evaluate concordance. It was found that the model trained with SOM outperformed the model trained with K-means, with improved detection of patients having vertebral problems. Additionally, it was found that the SOM and K-means models yielded similar precision as compared with models obtained with different algorithms reported elsewhere. The values yielded were in agreement with those of expert orthopedic physicians.},

	abstract = {IntroductionAdolescents‚Äô physical activity (PA) behavior can be driven by several psychosocial determinants at the same time. Most analyses use a variable-based approach that examines relations between PA-related determinants and PA behavior on the between-person level. Using this approach, possible coexistences of different psychosocial determinants within one person cannot be examined. Therefore, by applying a person-oriented approach, this study examined (a) which profiles regarding PA-related psychosocial variables typically occur in female sixth-graders, (b) if these profiles deliver a self-consistent picture according to theoretical assumptions, and (c) if the profiles contribute to the explanation of PA.Materials and MethodsThe sample comprised 475 female sixth-graders. Seventeen PA-related variables were assessed: support for autonomy, competence and relatedness in PE as well as their satisfaction in PE and leisure-time; behavioral regulation of exercise (five subscales); self-efficacy and social support from friends and family (two subscales). Moderate-to-vigorous PA was measured using accelerometers. Data were analyzed using the self-organizing maps (SOM) analysis, a cluster analysis including an unsupervised algorithm for non-linear models.ResultsAccording to the respective level of psychosocial resources, a positive, a medium and a negative cluster were identified. This superordinate cluster solution represented a self-consistent picture that was in line with theoretical assumptions. The three-cluster solution contributed to the explanation of PA behavior, with the positive cluster accumulating an average of 6 min more moderate-to-vigorous PA per day than the medium cluster and 10 min more than the negative cluster. Additionally, SOM detected a subgroup within the positive cluster that benefited from a specific combination of intrinsic and external regulations with regard to PA.DiscussionThe results underline the relevance of the assessed psychosocial determinants of PA behavior in female sixth-graders. The results further indicate that the different psychosocial resources within a given person do not develop independently of one another, which supports the use of a person-oriented approach. In addition, the SOM analysis identified subgroups with specific characteristics, which would have remained undetected using variable-based approaches. Thus, this approach offers the possibility to reduce data complexity without overlooking subgroups with special demands that go beyond the superordinate cluster solution.},

	abstract = {Collecting quantitative information on animal behaviours is difficult, especially from cryptic species or species that alter natural behaviours under observation. Using harness-mounted tri-axial accelerometers free-roaming domestic cats (Felis Catus) we developed a methodology that can precisely classify finer-scale behaviours. We further tested the effect of a prey‚Äìprotector device designed to reduce prey capture. We aligned accelerometer traces collected at 50¬†Hz with video files (60 fps) and labelled 12 individual behaviours, then trained a supervised machine-learning algorithm using Kohonen super self-organising maps (SOM). The SOM was able to predict individual behaviours with a‚Äâ{\textasciitilde}‚Äâ99.6\% overall accuracy, which was slightly better than for random forest estimates using the same dataset (98.9\%). There was a significant effect of sample size, with precision and sensitivity decreasing rapidly below 2000 1-s observations. We were also able to detect a behaviour specific reduction in the predictability when cats were fitted with the prey‚Äìprotector device indicating it altered biomechanical gait. Our results can be applied in movement ecology, zoology and conservation, where habitat specific movement performance between predators or prey may be critical to managing species of conservation significance, or in veterinary and agricultural fields, where early detection of movement pathologies can improve animal welfare.},

Moreover, a procedure for generating a ROC curve for k-means clustering is also described in this paper. Using a MRI database of 44 patients with 16 cirrhotic and 28 non-cirrhotic liver cases, k-means clustering achieves an area under the ROC curve (AUC) index of 0.704.

We leveraged baseline clinical biomarker data and long-term disease outcomes in UK Biobank to build prognostic multivariate survival models for over 200 most common diseases. We construct a similarity map between biomarker-disease hazard ratios and demonstrate broad patterns of shared similarity in biomarker profiles across the entire disease space. Further aggregation of risk profiles through density based clustering showed that biomarker-risk profiles can be partitioned into few distinct clusters with characteristic patterns representative of broad disease categories. To confirm these risk patterns we built disease co-occurrence networks in the UK Biobank and US HCUP hospitalization databases, and compared similarity in biomarker risk profiles to disease co-occurrence. We show that proximity in the biomarker-disease space is strongly related to the occurrence of disease comorbidity, suggesting biomarker profile patterns can be used for both predicting future outcomes as well as a sensitive mechanism for detecting under-diagnosed disease states.},

	abstract = {Background:
Wearable sensors (wearables) have been commonly integrated into a wide variety of commercial products and are increasingly being used to collect and process raw physiological parameters into salient digital health information. The data collected by wearables are currently being investigated across a broad set of clinical domains and patient populations. There is significant research occurring in the domain of algorithm development, with the aim of translating raw sensor data into fitness- or health-related outcomes of interest for users, patients, and health care providers.

Objectives:
The aim of this review is to highlight a selected group of fitness- and health-related indicators from wearables data and to describe several algorithmic approaches used to generate these higher order indicators.

Methods:
A systematic search of the Pubmed database was performed with the following search terms (number of records in parentheses): Fitbit algorithm (18), Apple Watch algorithm (3), Garmin algorithm (5), Microsoft Band algorithm (8), Samsung Gear algorithm (2), Xiaomi MiBand algorithm (1), Huawei Band (Watch) algorithm (2), photoplethysmography algorithm (465), accelerometry algorithm (966), ECG algorithm (8287), continuous glucose monitor algorithm (343). The search terms chosen for this review are focused on algorithms for wearable devices that dominated the commercial wearables market between 2014-2017 and that were highly represented in the biomedical literature. A second set of search terms included categories of algorithms for fitness-related and health-related indicators that are commonly used in wearable devices (e.g. accelerometry, PPG, ECG). These papers covered the following domain areas: fitness; exercise; movement; physical activity; step count; walking; running; swimming; energy expenditure; atrial fibrillation; arrhythmia; cardiovascular; autonomic nervous system; neuropathy; heart rate variability; fall detection; trauma; behavior change; diet; eating; stress detection; serum glucose monitoring; continuous glucose monitoring; diabetes mellitus type 1; diabetes mellitus type 2. All studies uncovered through this search on commercially available device algorithms and pivotal studies on sensor algorithm development were summarized, and a summary table was constructed using references generated by the literature review as described ().

Conclusions:
Wearable health technologies aim to collect and process raw physiological or environmental parameters into salient digital health information. Much of the current and future utility of wearables lies in the signal processing steps and algorithms used to analyze large volumes of data. Continued algorithmic development and advances in machine learning techniques will further increase analytic capabilities. In the context of these advances, our review aims to highlight a range of advances in fitness- and other health-related indicators provided by current wearable technologies.},

	abstract = {Patients with depression are at increased risk for a range of comorbid diseases, with, however, unclear explanations. In this large community-based cohort study of the UK Biobank, 24,130 patients diagnosed with depression were compared to 120,366 matched individuals without such a diagnosis. Follow-up was conducted from 6 months after the index date until death or the end of 2019, for the occurrence of 470 medical conditions and 16 specific causes of death. The median age at the time of the depression diagnosis was 62.0 years, and most of the patients were female (63.63\%). During a median follow-up of 4.94 years, 129 medical conditions were found to be significantly associated with a prior diagnosis of depression, based on adjusted Cox regression models. Using disease trajectory network analysis to visualize the magnitude of disease‚Äìdisease associations and the temporal order of the associated medical conditions, we identified three main affected disease clusters after depression (i.e., cardiometabolic diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, and diseases related to tobacco abuse), which were further linked to a wider range of other conditions. In addition, we also identified three depression-mortality trajectories leading to death due to cardiovascular disease, respiratory system disease and malignant neoplasm. In conclusion, an inpatient diagnosis of depression in later life is associated with three distinct network-based clusters of medical conditions, indicating alterations in the cardiometabolic system, chronic status of inflammation, and tobacco abuse as key pathways to a wide range of other conditions downstream. If replicated, these pathways may constitute promising targets for the health promotion among depression patients.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of chronic disease comorbidity and multimorbidity is a significant health issue worldwide. In many cases, for individuals, the occurrence of one chronic disease leads to the development of one or more other chronic conditions. This exerts a significant burden on healthcare systems globally. Disease comorbidity is defined as the simultaneous occurrence of more than one disease. And a person having more than two comorbidities is referred to as multimorbid. This study followed a machine learning and network analytics-based approach to predict major chronic disease comorbidity and multimorbidity. In doing so, this study first extracted patient networks from the research dataset. In such networks, nodes represent patients and edges between two nodes indicate that the underlying two patients had at least one common disease. This study also considered other relevant features from patients‚Äô health trajectories. Out of the five machine learning models considered in this study (Logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting) and two deep learning models (Multilayer perceptrons and Convolutional neural networks), Extreme Gradient Boosting showed the highest accuracy (95.05\%), followed by the Convolutional neural networks (91.67\%). The attribute of the number of episodes from the patient trajectory had been found as the most important feature, followed by the patient network attribute of transitivity. Other relevant results (feature correlation, variable clustering, confusion matrix and kernel density estimation) were also reported and discussed. The findings and insights of this study can help healthcare stakeholders and policymakers mitigate the negative impact of disease comorbidity and multimorbidity.},

	abstract = {Today's digital health revolution aims to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery and make care more personalized and timely. Sources of data for digital health tools include multiple modalities such as electronic medical records (EMR), radiology images, and genetic repositories, to name a few. While historically, these data were utilized in silos, new machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies enable the integration of these data sources to produce multi-modal insights. Data fusion, which integrates data from multiple modalities using ML and DL techniques, has been of growing interest in its application to medicine. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art research that focuses on how the latest techniques in data fusion are providing scientific and clinical insights specific to the field of cardiovascular medicine. With these new data fusion capabilities, clinicians and researchers alike will advance the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) to deliver more timely, accurate, and precise patient care.},

	abstract = {Our aim was to validate optimal action points in written action plans for early detection of asthma exacerbations.
We analysed daily symptoms and morning peak expiratory flows (PEFs) from two previous studies. Potential action points were based on analysis of symptom scores (standard deviations) percentage of personal best PEF, PEF variability in relation to a run-in period or combinations of these measures. Sensitivity and specificity for predicting exacerbations were obtained for each action point. The numbers needed to treat to prevent one exacerbation and the time interval between reaching action point criteria and the start of the exacerbation were calculated. Based on these parameters, the optimal action points for symptoms, PEF and PEF plus symptoms were determined, and their performance compared with published guidelines‚Äô action points.
The optimal action points were, for symptoms, statistical variability (standard deviations) and, for PEF, {\textless}70\% of personal best. The combination of PEF plus symptoms performed best, with improved specificity and earlier detection. The main benefits associated with using these action points was to reduce false positive rates for detecting exacerbations.
Early detection of asthma exacerbations can be improved using a composite action point comprising symptoms and PEF measurements over 1 week.},

There are minimal medical care and personal trainers‚Äô methods to monitor a patient‚Äôs actual physical activity types. To improve activity monitoring, we propose an artificial-intelligence-based approach to classify physical movement activity patterns. In more detail, we employ two deep learning (DL) methods, namely a deep feed-forward neural network (DNN) and a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) for this purpose. We evaluate the two models on two physical movement datasets collected from several volunteers who carried tri-axial accelerometer sensors. The first dataset is from the UCI machine learning repository, which contains 14 different activities-of-daily-life (ADL) and is collected from 16 volunteers who carried a single wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer. The second dataset includes ten other ADLs and is gathered from eight volunteers who placed the sensors on their hips. Our experiment results show that the RNN model provides accurate performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods in classifying the fundamental movement patterns with an overall accuracy of 84.89\% and an overall F1-score of 82.56\%. The results indicate that our method provides the medical doctors and trainers a promising way to track and understand a patient‚Äôs physical activities precisely for better treatment.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a resource-intensive global pandemic. It is important for healthcare systems to identify high-risk COVID-19-positive patients who need timely health care. This study was conducted to predict the hospitalization of older adults who have tested positive for COVID-19.
METHODS: We screened all patients with COVID test records from 11 Mass General Brigham hospitals to identify the study population. A total of 1495 patients with age 65 and above from the outpatient setting were included in the final cohort, among which 459 patients were hospitalized. We conducted a clinician-guided, 3-stage feature selection, and phenotyping process using iterative combinations of literature review, clinician expert opinion, and electronic healthcare record data exploration. A list of 44 features, including temporal features, was generated from this process and used for model training. Four machine learning prediction models were developed, including regularized logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and neural network.
RESULTS: All 4 models achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) greater than 0.80. Random forest achieved the best predictive performance (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.83). Albumin, an index for nutritional status, was found to have the strongest association with hospitalization among COVID positive older adults.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed 4 machine learning models for predicting general hospitalization among COVID positive older adults. We identified important clinical factors associated with hospitalization and observed temporal patterns in our study cohort. Our modeling pipeline and algorithm could potentially be used to facilitate more accurate and efficient decision support for triaging COVID positive patients.},

	abstract = {Background
This study aimed to develop a deep-learning model and a risk-score system using clinical variables to predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients.

Methods
This retrospective study consisted of 5,766 persons-under-investigation for COVID-19 between 7 February 2020 and 4 May 2020. Demographics, chronic comorbidities, vital signs, symptoms and laboratory tests at admission were collected. A deep neural network model and a risk-score system were constructed to predict ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Prediction performance used the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC).

Results
The top ICU predictors were procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin and oxygen saturation. The top mortality predictors were age, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, cardiac troponin, C-reactive protein and oxygen saturation. Age and troponin were unique top predictors for mortality but not ICU admission. The deep-learning model predicted ICU admission and mortality with an AUC of 0.780 (95\% CI [0.760‚Äì0.785]) and 0.844 (95\% CI [0.839‚Äì0.848]), respectively. The corresponding risk scores yielded an AUC of 0.728 (95\% CI [0.726‚Äì0.729]) and 0.848 (95\% CI [0.847‚Äì0.849]), respectively.

Conclusions
Deep learning and the resultant risk score have the potential to provide frontline physicians with quantitative tools to stratify patients more effectively in time-sensitive and resource-constrained circumstances.},

	abstract = {Healthcare data are inherently multimodal, including electronic health records (EHR), medical images, and multi-omics data. Combining these multimodal data sources contributes to a better understanding of human health and provides optimal personalized healthcare. The most important question when using multimodal data is how to fuse them‚Äîa field of growing interest among researchers. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly machine learning (ML), enable the fusion of these different data modalities to provide multimodal insights. To this end, in this scoping review, we focus on synthesizing and analyzing the literature that uses AI techniques to fuse multimodal medical data for different clinical applications. More specifically, we focus on studies that only fused EHR with medical imaging data to develop various AI methods for clinical applications. We present a comprehensive analysis of the various fusion strategies, the diseases and clinical outcomes for which multimodal fusion was used, the ML algorithms used to perform multimodal fusion for each clinical application, and the available multimodal medical datasets. We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. We searched Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar to retrieve relevant studies. After pre-processing and screening, we extracted data from 34 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We found that studies fusing imaging data with EHR are increasing and doubling from 2020 to 2021. In our analysis, a typical workflow was observed: feeding raw data, fusing different data modalities by applying conventional machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) algorithms, and finally, evaluating the multimodal fusion through clinical outcome predictions. Specifically, early fusion was the most used technique in most applications for multimodal learning (22 out of 34 studies). We found that multimodality fusion models outperformed traditional single-modality models for the same task. Disease diagnosis and prediction were the most common clinical outcomes (reported in 20 and 10 studies, respectively) from a clinical outcome perspective. Neurological disorders were the dominant category (16 studies). From an AI perspective, conventional ML models were the most used (19 studies), followed by DL models (16 studies). Multimodal data used in the included studies were mostly from private repositories (21 studies). Through this scoping review, we offer new insights for researchers interested in knowing the current state of knowledge within this research field.},

Retrospective design where health Records from 42,526 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in Denmark was extracted. Random Forest (RF) models were trained to predict risk of ICU admission and use of mechanical ventilation after n days (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1, 2, ‚Ä¶, 15). An extended analysis was provided for n‚Äâ=‚Äâ5 and n‚Äâ=‚Äâ10. Models predicted n-day risk of ICU admission with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) between 0.981 and 0.995, and n-day risk of use of ventilation with an ROC-AUC between 0.982 and 0.997. The corresponding n-day forecasting models predicted the needed ICU capacity with a coefficient of determination (R2) between 0.334 and 0.989 and use of ventilation with an R2 between 0.446 and 0.973. The forecasting models performed worst, when forecasting many days into the future (for large n). For n‚Äâ=‚Äâ5, ICU capacity was predicted with ROC-AUC 0.990 and R2 0.928, and use of ventilator was predicted with ROC-AUC 0.994 and R2 0.854.

Clinical triage and risk assessment have become increasingly challenging due to the shortage of medical resources and the strain on hospital infrastructure caused by the pandemic. As a result of the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs), we now have access to a vast amount of clinical data, which allows us to develop prediction models and decision support systems to address these challenges. To date, there is no widely accepted clinical prediction benchmark related to the ED based on large-scale public EHRs. An open-source benchmark data platform would streamline research workflows by eliminating cumbersome data preprocessing, and facilitate comparisons among different studies and methodologies. Based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV Emergency Department (MIMIC-IV-ED) database, we created a benchmark dataset and proposed three clinical prediction benchmarks.

	abstract = {Background: Risk scores can be useful in clinical risk stratification and accurate allocations of medical resources, helping health providers improve patient care. Point-based scores are more understandable and explainable than other complex models and are now widely used in clinical decision making. However, the development of the risk scoring model is nontrivial and has not yet been systematically presented, with few studies investigating methods of clinical score generation using electronic health records.
Objective: This study aims to propose AutoScore, a machine learning‚Äìbased automatic clinical score generator consisting of 6 modules for developing interpretable point-based scores. Future users can employ the AutoScore framework to create clinical scores effortlessly in various clinical applications.
Methods: We proposed the AutoScore framework comprising 6 modules that included variable ranking, variable transformation, score derivation, model selection, score fine-tuning, and model evaluation. To demonstrate the performance of AutoScore, we used data from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to build a scoring model for mortality prediction and then compared the data with other baseline models using the receiver operating characteristic analysis. A software package in R 3.5.3 (R Foundation) was also developed to demonstrate the implementation of AutoScore.
Results: Implemented on the data set with 44,918 individual admission episodes of intensive care, the AutoScore-created scoring models performed comparably well as other standard methods (ie, logistic regression, stepwise regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and random forest) in terms of predictive accuracy and model calibration but required fewer predictors and presented high interpretability and accessibility. The nine-variable, AutoScore-created, point-based scoring model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.780 (95\% CI 0.764-0.798), whereas the model of logistic regression with 24 variables had an AUC of 0.778 (95\% CI 0.760-0.795). Moreover, the AutoScore framework also drives the clinical research continuum and automation with its integration of all necessary modules.
Conclusions: We developed an easy-to-use, machine learning‚Äìbased automatic clinical score generator, AutoScore; systematically presented its structure; and demonstrated its superiority (predictive performance and interpretability) over other conventional methods using a benchmark database. AutoScore will emerge as a potential scoring tool in various medical applications.},

We sought to determine a non-invasive technique for objective stress monitoring. Data were collected from firefighters during 24-h shifts using sensor belts equipped with a dry-lead electrocardiograph (ECG) and a three-axial accelerometer. Levels of stress experienced during fire incidents were evaluated via a brief self-assessment questionnaire. Types of physical activity were distinguished basing on accelerometer readings, and heart rate variability (HRV) time series were segmented accordingly into corresponding fragments. Those segments were classified as stress/no-stress conditions. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed true positive classification as stress condition for 15\% of incidents (while maintaining almost zero False Positive Rate), which parallels the amount of truly stressful incidents reported in the questionnaires. These results show a firm correspondence between the perceived stress level and physiological data. Psychophysiological measurements are reliable indicators of stress even in ecological settings and appear promising for chronic stress monitoring in high-risk jobs, such as firefighting.},

	abstract = {DNA methylation age (DNAm age) has become a widely utilized epigenetic biomarker for the aging process. The Horvath method for determining DNAm age is perhaps the most widely utilized and validated DNA methylation age assessment measure. Horvath DNAm age is calculated based on methylation measurements at 353 loci, present on Illumina‚Äôs 450k and 27k DNA methylation microarrays. With increasing use of the more recently developed Illumina MethylationEPIC (850k) microarray, it is worth revisiting this aging measure to evaluate estimation differences due to array design. Of the requisite 353 loci, 17 are missing from the 850k microarray. Similarly, an alternate, 71 loci DNA methylation age assessment measure created by Hannum et al. is missing 6 requisite loci. Using 17 datasets with 27k, 450k, and/or 850k methylation data, we compared each sample‚Äôs epigenetic age estimated from all 353 loci required by the Horvath DNAm age calculator, and using only the 336 loci available on the 850k array. In 450k/27k data, removing loci not on the 850k array resulted in underestimation of Horvath‚Äôs DNAm age. Underestimation of Horvath DNAm age increased from ages 0 to {\textasciitilde}20, remaining stable thereafter (mean deviation = -3.46 y, SD = 1.13 for individuals ‚â•20 years). Underestimation of Horvath‚Äôs DNAm age by the reduced 450k/27k data was similar to the underestimation observed in the 850k data indicating it is driven by missing probes. In analogous examination of Hannum‚Äôs DNAm age, the magnitude and direction of epigenetic age misestimation varied with chronological age. In conclusion, inter-array deviations in DNAm age estimations may be largely driven by missing probes between arrays, despite default probe imputation procedures. Though correlations and associations based on Horvath‚Äôs DNAm age may be unaffected, researchers should exercise caution when interpreting results based on absolute differences in DNAm age or when mixing samples assayed on different arrays.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, humans face various diseases due to the current environmental condition and their living habits. The identification and prediction of such diseases at their earlier stages are much important, so as to prevent the extremity of it. It is difficult for doctors to manually identify the diseases accurately most of the time. The goal of this paper is to identify and predict the patients with more common chronic illnesses. This could be achieved by using a cutting-edge machine learning technique to ensure that this categorization reliably identifies persons with chronic diseases. The prediction of diseases is also a challenging task. Hence, data mining plays a critical role in disease prediction. The proposed system offers a broad disease prognosis based on patient's symptoms by using the machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction and disease prediction and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) for distance calculation to find the exact match in the data set and the final disease prediction outcome. A collection of disease symptoms has been performed for the preparation of the data set along with the person's living habits, and details related to doctor consultations are taken into account in this general disease prediction. Finally, a comparative study of the proposed system with various algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes, decision tree, and logistic regression has been demonstrated in this paper.},

As chronic diseases share similar characteristics, it is possible to predict multiple chronic diseases using the accumulated data of each patient. Thus, we propose an intra-person multi-task learning framework that jointly predicts the status of correlated chronic diseases and improves the model performance. Because chronic diseases occur over a long period and are affected by various factors, we considered features related to each chronic disease and the temporal relationship of the time-series data for accurate prediction. The study was carried out in three stages: (1) data preprocessing and feature selection using bidirectional recurrent imputation for time series (BRITS) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO); (2) a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) for single-task models; and (3) a novel intra-person multi-task learning CNN-LSTM framework developed to predict multiple chronic diseases simultaneously. Our multi-task learning method between correlated chronic diseases produced a more stable and accurate system than single-task models and other baseline recurrent networks. Furthermore, the proposed model was tested using different time steps to illustrate its flexibility and generalization across multiple time steps.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Between 2013 and 2015, the UK Biobank collected accelerometer traces from 103,712 volunteers aged between 40 and 69 years using wrist-worn triaxial accelerometers for 1 week. This data set has been used in the past to verify that individuals with chronic diseases exhibit reduced activity levels compared with healthy populations. However, the data set is likely to be noisy, as the devices were allocated to participants without a set of inclusion criteria, and the traces reflect free-living conditions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the extent to which accelerometer traces can be used to distinguish individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) from normoglycemic controls and to quantify their limitations.
METHODS: Machine learning classifiers were trained using different feature sets to segregate individuals with T2D from normoglycemic individuals. Multiple criteria, based on a combination of self-assessment UK Biobank variables and primary care health records linked to UK Biobank participants, were used to identify 3103 individuals with T2D in this population. The remaining nondiabetic 19,852 participants were further scored on their physical activity impairment severity based on other conditions found in their primary care data, and those deemed likely physically impaired at the time were excluded. Physical activity features were first extracted from the raw accelerometer traces data set for each participant using an algorithm that extends the previously developed Biobank Accelerometry Analysis toolkit from Oxford University. These features were complemented by a selected collection of sociodemographic and lifestyle features available from UK Biobank.
RESULTS: We tested 3 types of classifiers, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) close to 0.86 (95\% CI 0.85-0.87) for all 3 classifiers and F1 scores in the range of 0.80-0.82 for T2D-positive individuals and 0.73-0.74 for T2D-negative controls. Results obtained using nonphysically impaired controls were compared with highly physically impaired controls to test the hypothesis that nondiabetic conditions reduce classifier performance. Models built using a training set that included highly impaired controls with other conditions had worse performance (AUC 0.75-0.77; 95\% CI 0.74-0.78; F1 scores in the range of 0.76-0.77 for T2D positives and 0.63-0.65 for controls).
CONCLUSIONS: Granular measures of free-living physical activity can be used to successfully train machine learning models that are able to discriminate between individuals with T2D and normoglycemic controls, although with limitations because of the intrinsic noise in the data sets. From a broader clinical perspective, these findings motivate further research into the use of physical activity traces as a means of screening individuals at risk of diabetes and for early detection, in conjunction with routinely used risk scores, provided that appropriate quality control is enforced on the data collection protocol.},

	abstract = {Background
Socioeconomic position as measured by education may be embodied and affect the functioning of key physiological systems. Links between social disadvantage, its biological imprint, and cause-specific mortality and morbidity have not been investigated in large populations, and yet may point towards areas for public health interventions beyond targeting individual behaviours.
Methods
Using data from 366,748 UK Biobank participants with 13 biomarker measurements, we calculated a Biological Health Score (BHS, ranging from 0 to 1) capturing the level of functioning of five physiological systems. Associations between BHS and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, and mortality from all, CVD, cancer, and external causes were examined. We explored the role of education in these associations. Mendelian randomisation using genetic evidence was used to triangulate these findings.
Findings
An increase in BHS of 0.1 was associated with all-cause (HR¬†=¬†1.14 [1.12‚Äì1.16] and 1.09 [1.07‚Äì1.12] in men and women respectively), cancer (HR¬†=¬†1.11 [1.09‚Äì1.14] and 1.07 [1.04‚Äì1.10]) and CVD (HR¬†=¬†1.25 [1.20‚Äì1.31] and 1.21 [1.11‚Äì1.31]) mortality, CVD incidence (HR¬†=¬†1.15 [1.13‚Äì1.16] and 1.17 [1.15‚Äì1.19]). These associations survived adjustment for education, lifestyle-behaviours, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities and medical treatments. Mendelian randomisation further supported the link between the BHS and CVD incidence (HR¬†=¬†1.31 [1.21‚Äì1.42]). The BHS contributed to CVD incidence prediction (age-adjusted C-statistic¬†=¬†0.58), other than through education and health behaviours.
Interpretation
The BHS captures features of the embodiment of education, health behaviours, and more proximal unknown factors which all complementarily contribute to all-cause, cancer and CVD morbidity and premature death.},

	abstract = {Background: COVID-19 is a major public health concern. Given the extent of the pandemic, it is urgent to identify risk factors associated with disease severity. More accurate prediction of those at risk of developing severe infections is of high clinical importance.
Objective: Based on the UK Biobank (UKBB), we aimed to build machine learning models to predict the risk of developing severe or fatal infections, and uncover major risk factors involved.
Methods: We first restricted the analysis to infected individuals (n=7846), then performed analysis at a population level, considering those with no known infection as controls (ncontrols=465,728). Hospitalization was used as a proxy for severity. A total of 97 clinical variables (collected prior to the COVID-19 outbreak) covering demographic variables, comorbidities, blood measurements (eg, hematological/liver/renal function/metabolic parameters), anthropometric measures, and other risk factors (eg, smoking/drinking) were included as predictors. We also constructed a simplified (lite) prediction model using 27 covariates that can be more easily obtained (demographic and comorbidity data). XGboost (gradient-boosted trees) was used for prediction and predictive performance was assessed by cross-validation. Variable importance was quantified by Shapley values (ShapVal), permutation importance (PermImp), and accuracy gain. Shapley dependency and interaction plots were used to evaluate the pattern of relationships between risk factors and outcomes.
Results: A total of 2386 severe and 477 fatal cases were identified. For analyses within infected individuals (n=7846), our prediction model achieved area under the receiving-operating characteristic curve (AUC‚ÄìROC) of 0.723 (95\% CI 0.711-0.736) and 0.814 (95\% CI 0.791-0.838) for severe and fatal infections, respectively. The top 5 contributing factors (sorted by ShapVal) for severity were age, number of drugs taken (cnt\_tx), cystatin C (reflecting renal function), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and Townsend deprivation index (TDI). For mortality, the top features were age, testosterone, cnt\_tx, waist circumference (WC), and red cell distribution width. For analyses involving the whole UKBB population, AUCs for severity and fatality were 0.696 (95\% CI 0.684-0.708) and 0.825 (95\% CI 0.802-0.848), respectively. The same top 5 risk factors were identified for both outcomes, namely, age, cnt\_tx, WC, WHR, and TDI. Apart from the above, age, cystatin C, TDI, and cnt\_tx were among the top 10 across all 4 analyses. Other diseases top ranked by ShapVal or PermImp were type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and dementia, among others. For the ‚Äúlite‚Äù models, predictive performances were broadly similar, with estimated AUCs of 0.716, 0.818, 0.696, and 0.830, respectively. The top ranked variables were similar to above, including age, cnt\_tx, WC, sex (male), and T2DM.
Conclusions: We identified numerous baseline clinical risk factors for severe/fatal infection by XGboost. For example, age, central obesity, impaired renal function, multiple comorbidities, and cardiometabolic abnormalities may predispose to poorer outcomes. The prediction models may be useful at a population level to identify those susceptible to developing severe/fatal infections, facilitating targeted prevention strategies. A risk-prediction tool is also available online. Further replications in independent cohorts are required to verify our findings.},

	abstract = {Inflammation is a facilitating process for multiple cancer types. It is believed to affect cancer development and progression through several etiologic pathways including increased levels of DNA adduct formation, increased angiogenesis and altered anti-apoptotic signaling. This review highlights the application of inflammatory biomarkers in epidemiologic studies and discusses the various cellular mediators of inflammation characterizing the innate immune system response to infection and chronic insult from environmental factors. Included is a review of six classes of inflammation-related biomarkers: cytokines/chemokines, immune-related effectors, acute phase proteins, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, prostaglandins and cyclooxygenase-related factors, and mediators such as transcription factors and growth factors. For each of these biomarkers we provide a brief overview of the etiologic role in the inflammation response and how they have been related to cancer etiology and progression within the literature. We provide a discussion of the common techniques available for quantification of each marker including strengths, weaknesses and potential pitfalls. Subsequently, we highlight a few under-studied measures to characterize the inflammatory response and their potential utility in epidemiologic studies of cancer. Finally, we suggest integrative methods for future studies to apply multi-faceted approaches to examine the relationship between inflammatory markers and their roles in cancer development.},

	abstract = {Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most commonly encountered infections in outpatients. The distinction between upper UTI and lower UTI is significant as it has therapeutic and prognostic importance. The accurate diagnosis of UTI, especially its anatomical location, is essential for administering anti-microbial therapy successfully. Plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) increase 1,000-fold during bacterial infections.¬†Elevated CRP levels are often seen in acute pyelonephritis and rarely in cystitis. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic role of serum CRP in upper and lower UTI in adult patients along with correlating its role in UTI patients., Materials and methods: The study included 81 patients who were {\textgreater}18 years old, diagnosed with UTI by microbiological culture and ultrasonography of the pelvis. Demographic data along with findings of the systemic examination, complete blood count, random blood sugar, urine analysis, and CRP levels of all patients were recorded. Data were analyzed using R Studio.3.5.3 software, and a¬†p-value ‚â§ 0.05 was considered significant., Results: The prevalence of UTI was higher among females (60.49\%). About 53.09\% of patients exhibited upper and 46.91\% exhibited lower UTI. The prevalence of Escherichia coli was higher among cases of both upper (88.37\%) and lower (65.79\%) UTI. The most common final diagnosis in upper UTI patients was acute pyelonephritis (90.7\%) and that in lower UTI was cystitis (65.79\%). The difference in the CRP levels between the upper and lower UTI patients was significant (p=0.02). Thirty-four patients had CRP levels {\textgreater}100 mg/L, all exhibiting upper UTI., Conclusion: About 53.09\% of patients exhibited upper UTI and were diagnosed with acute pyelonephritis. A significant increase in the CRP levels in upper UTI can help determine the anatomical location and can help in targeting effective management of the infection by anti-microbial therapy.},

TNF-related apoptosis induced ligand (TRAIL), interferon gamma induced protein-10 (IP-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP) exhibit differential expression in the blood in response to bacterial vs. viral infection. We assessed if the urinary and serum levels of these host biomarkers discriminate UTI, nephronia, and response to antibiotic treatment., Methods: Hospitalized febrile children aged {\textless}18 years with suspected UTI based on abnormal urinalysis were recruited prospectively between 2016 and 2018; also, non-febrile controls were recruited. Following urine culture results and hospitalization course, participants were divided into three groups based on AAP criteria and expert adjudication: UTI, viral infection, and indeterminate., Results: Seventy-three children were enrolled, 61 with suspected UTI and 12 non-febrile controls. Of the 61 with suspected UTI, 40 were adjudicated as UTI, 10 viral infection, and 11 as indeterminate. Urinary CRP and IP-10 levels were significantly higher in the UTI group (p ‚â§ 0.05). Urinary CRP differentiated UTI from non-bacterial etiology in children under and over 3 months of age, with AUCs 0.98 (95\% CI: 0.93‚Äì1.00) and 0.82 (0.68‚Äì0.95), respectively. Similarly, urinary IP-10 discriminated with AUCs of 0.80 (0.59‚Äì1.00) and 0.90 (0.80‚Äì1.00), respectively. Serum CRP and IP-10 levels were significantly higher in UTI cases with nephronia (p ‚â§ 0.03).

	doi = {10.1111/crj.12471},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical value of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in lung cancer patients.
METHODS: A total of 172 healthy control subjects and 164 patients with histopathologically confirmed lung cancer were enrolled in this study. The FeNO measurements and pulmonary function tests were conducted in the Chinese PLA General Hospital. The recorded data included FeNO, the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1 ), the forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1 /FVC, the FEV1 (\% predicted), the demographic characteristics, the presence of complications and the smoking status.
RESULTS: The patients with lung cancer had a significantly higher level of eNO than the healthy control subjects (33.85‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ15.63 ppb, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ163; 16.83‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ4.17 ppb, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ172; P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.01). The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves for eNO predicting airway inflammation in lung cancer subjects and healthy control subjects was 0.932 (95\% confidence interval: 0.904-0.961). In¬†the lung cancer group, the eNO levels in the squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, small-cell lung cancer and lung carcinoid tumor groups were significantly different (P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.01). Lung cancer patients with a predicted FEV1 \% value {\textless}80\% had a higher level of eNO than the patients with a predicted FEV1 \% value ‚â•80\%.
CONCLUSIONS: The eNO levels in patients with lung cancer were higher than the normal level, especially in the patients with squamous cell carcinoma and small-cell lung cancer. The differences in eNO among the lung cancer subtypes were statistically significant. Measuring eNO will be helpful in diagnosing airway inflammation in lung cancer and in the classification of lung cancer.},

FeNO can be used to monitor airway inflammation, but individual responses make tailored interventions based on FeNO difficult. The correlation between the asthma control test (ACT), FEV1, and FeNO was evaluated in this study to ascertain the correct usage of FeNO with different asthma phenotypes regarding their control, allergy, comorbidity, obesity, age, smoking status, and severity. ACT, pulmonary function, and FeNO in 416 asthmatic patients on combined therapy were retrospective evaluated. Correlations between these parameters and the FeNO levels in different asthma phenotypes were calculated. In the study population, FeNO was 31.8 ¬± 28.5 parts per billion (ppb), FEV1 was 83.4 ¬± 19\% and ACT was 19 ¬± 5.2. ACT scores were negatively correlated with FeNO (r = ‚àí0.31; p = 0.002). FeNO was different in patients with positive and negative skin-prick test (p {\textless} 0.05), with and without allergic rhinitis (p {\textless} 0.01), and with and without allergic conjunctivitis (p {\textless} 0.01). Significantly higher FeNO levels were found with logistic regression analysis only in patients with a history of emergency room visits (ERVs) (p = 0.024). The rate of the ERV of the patients with an ACT score more than or equal to 20 and with a FeNO value of more than 35 ppb was 22.9\%, but with a FeNO value of less than 35 ppb was 6.5\% (p = 0.004). Allergy and allergic comorbidities may lead to an increase in FeNO levels. Patients with a history of ERV have markedly higher FeNO levels, although they have an ACT score more than or equal to 20.},

The article provides in-depth information on the retrieved articles and discusses study shortcomings related to demographic factors, i.e., age, gender, healthy participants vs patients, and study conditions. It is well known that motion patterns change with age and the onset of illnesses, and that the risk of falling increases with age. Yet, studies including older persons are rare. Gender distribution was not even provided in several studies, and others included only, or a majority of, men. Another shortcoming is that none of the studies were conducted in real-life conditions. Hence, there is still important work to be done in order to increase the usefulness of wearable sensors in these areas. The article highlights flaws in how studies based on previously collected datasets report on study samples and the data collected, which makes the validity and generalizability of those studies low.

Here, we examined the association of VILPA with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality in 25,241 nonexercisers (mean age 61.8‚Äâyears, 14,178 women/11,063 men) in the UK Biobank. Over an average follow-up of 6.9‚Äâyears, during which 852 deaths occurred, VILPA was inversely associated with all three of these outcomes in a near-linear fashion. Compared with participants who engaged in no VILPA, participants who engaged in VILPA at the sample median VILPA frequency of 3‚Äâlength-standardized bouts per day (lasting 1 or 2‚Äâmin each) showed a 38\%‚Äì40\% reduction in all-cause and cancer mortality risk and a 48\%‚Äì49\% reduction in CVD mortality risk. Moreover, the sample median VILPA duration of 4.4‚Äâmin per day was associated with a 26\%‚Äì30\% reduction in all-cause and cancer mortality risk and a 32\%‚Äì34\% reduction in CVD mortality risk. We obtained similar results when repeating the above analyses for vigorous physical activity (VPA) in 62,344 UK Biobank participants who exercised (1,552 deaths, 35,290 women/27,054 men). These results indicate that small amounts of vigorous nonexercise physical activity are associated with substantially lower mortality. VILPA in nonexercisers appears to elicit similar effects to VPA in exercisers, suggesting that VILPA may be a suitable physical activity target, especially in people not able or willing to exercise.},

Most brain-age research uses structural neuroimaging to index brain volume. However, aging affects multiple aspects of brain structure and function, which can be examined using multimodality neuroimaging. Using UK Biobank, brain-age was modeled in n¬†= 2205 healthy people with T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, T2‚àó, diffusion-MRI, task fMRI, and resting-state fMRI. In a held-out healthy validation set (n¬†= 520), chronological age was accurately predicted (r¬†= 0.78, mean absolute error¬†= 3.55¬†years) using LASSO regression, higher than using any modality separately. Thirty-four neuroimaging phenotypes were deemed informative by the regression (after bootstrapping); predominantly gray-matter volume and white-matter microstructure measures. When applied to new individuals from UK Biobank (n¬†= 14,701), significant associations with multimodality brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) were found for stroke history, diabetes diagnosis, smoking, alcohol intake and some, but not all, cognitive measures (corrected p {\textless} 0.05). Multimodality neuroimaging can improve brain-age prediction, and derived brain-PAD values are sensitive to biomedical and lifestyle factors that negatively impact brain and cognitive health.},

The identification of vitamin D as a biomarker of physiological/pathological ageing could contribute to expanding current knowledge of its involvement in healthy ageing. Methods: According to PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted on cohorts studying the role of 25OH-Vitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25(OH)2-Vitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] concentrations as biomarkers of healthy ageing. We consulted MedLine, Scopus, and Web of Science to search for studies on the association between vitamin D status in populations of originally healthy adults, and outcomes of longevity, illness, and physical and cognitive functionality. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Results: Twenty cohorts from 24 articles were selected for this review. Inverse associations were found between low 25(OH)D levels and all-cause mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular events, as well as markers relating to hip and non-vertebral fractures. Associations between 1,25(OH)2D and healthy ageing outcomes gave similar results, although of lower clinical significance. Conclusions: This systematic review pinpoints peculiar aspects of vitamin D as a multidimensional predictor of ill health in the ageing process. Further well-designed controlled trials to investigate whether vitamin D supplement results in superior outcomes are warranted in the future.},

	abstract = {Reducing sedentary behavior and increasing physical activity may be important for maintaining good cardiometabolic health. However, many studies have focused on the independent effect of sedentary behavior and physical activity, but it is unclear whether replacing time spent in sedentary behavior with physical activity is beneficial for cardiometabolic health. Therefore, this population-based cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the effect of behavioral transformations between sedentary behavior and level of physical activity on cardiometabolic health in Korean adults using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2014‚Äì2017. The study participants included 2197 adults from the KNHANES. In the partition model, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was significantly associated with adverse cardiometabolic health, adjusted for potential confounding factors. The odds ratio for adverse cardiometabolic health significantly decreased with the replacement of sedentary behavior and light intensity activity with MVPA in the isotemporal substitution model (p {\textless} 0.05). In the models stratified by sex, we observed significant associations between handgrip strength and cardiometabolic health in women (p {\textless} 0.001), but not in men. Thus, our findings suggest that replacing sedentary behavior with MVPA may contribute to improved cardiometabolic health.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES
The aim of this study was to identify the stepping cadence patterns in Korean adults by using objectively measured accelerometer data to analyze the time spent in each cadence category by sex and age.

METHODS
During the 2014-2015 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1,703 males and females aged 19-64 years provided at least 1 valid day of data (wearing an accelerometer ‚â• 10 hr/d). The mean cumulative time and percentage per day in 8 cadence categories (0, 1-19, 20-29, 30-59, 60-79, 80-99, 100-119, and ‚â• 120 steps/min) by sex and age group were calculated.

RESULTS
Cumulative time and percentage per day decreased across the incremental cadence categories. Participants spent 360.08¬± 2.56 min/d in the non-movement cadence category and 361.50¬± 2.28 min/d in the incidental movement cadence category. However, they spent only about 18.1 min/d (2.1\%) at ‚â• 100 steps/min. Males spent significantly more time in the cadence categories of sporadic movement, purposeful steps, slow walking, and medium walking, but the other categories, except for brisk walking, had higher values in females (p{\textless} 0.001). The older age group spent less time in non-movement cadence categories, and the youngest and oldest groups spent more time at a higher cadence (‚â• 100 steps/min) than the other age groups. Similar patterns were found in a subgroup analysis by sex.

CONCLUSIONS
Korean adults spent most of their time at a low cadence and only a few minutes at a high cadence (‚â•100 steps/min); this trend was consistent across sex and age groups.},

	abstract = {Background: Data collected by an actigraphy device worn on the wrist or waist can provide objective measurements for studies related to physical activity; however, some data may contain intervals where values are missing. In previous studies, statistical methods have been applied to impute missing values on the basis of statistical assumptions. Deep learning algorithms, however, can learn features from the data without any such assumptions and may outperform previous approaches in imputation tasks.
Objective: The aim of this study was to impute missing values in data using a deep learning approach.
Methods: To develop an imputation model for missing values in accelerometer-based actigraphy data, a denoising convolutional autoencoder was adopted. We trained and tested our deep learning‚Äìbased imputation model with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data set and validated it with the external Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the Korean Chronic Cerebrovascular Disease Oriented Biobank data sets which consist of daily records measuring activity counts. The partial root mean square error and partial mean absolute error of the imputed intervals (partial RMSE and partial MAE, respectively) were calculated using our deep learning‚Äìbased imputation model (zero-inflated denoising convolutional autoencoder) as well as using other approaches (mean imputation, zero-inflated Poisson regression, and Bayesian regression).
Results: The zero-inflated denoising convolutional autoencoder exhibited a partial RMSE of 839.3 counts and partial MAE of 431.1 counts, whereas mean imputation achieved a partial RMSE of 1053.2 counts and partial MAE of 545.4 counts, the zero-inflated Poisson regression model achieved a partial RMSE of 1255.6 counts and partial MAE of 508.6 counts, and Bayesian regression achieved a partial RMSE of 924.5 counts and partial MAE of 605.8 counts.
Conclusions: Our deep learning‚Äìbased imputation model performed better than the other methods when imputing missing values in actigraphy data.},

	abstract = {Aging has pronounced effects on blood laboratory biomarkers used in the clinic. Prior studies have largely investigated one biomarker or population at a time, limiting a comprehensive view of biomarker variation and aging across different populations. Here we develop a supervised machine learning approach to study aging using 356 blood biomarkers measured in 67,563 individuals across diverse populations. Our model predicts age with a mean absolute error (MAE), or average magnitude of prediction errors, in held-out data of 4.76 years and an R2 value of 0.92. Age prediction was highly accurate for the pediatric cohort (MAE = 0.87, R2 = 0.94) but inaccurate for ages 65+ (MAE = 4.30, R2 = 0.25). Variability was observed in which biomarkers carry predictive power across age groups, genders, and race/ethnicity groups, and novel candidate biomarkers of aging were identified for specific age ranges (e.g. Vitamin E, ages 18-44). We show that predictors for one age group may fail to generalize to other groups and investigate non-linearity in biomarkers near adulthood. As populations worldwide undergo major demographic changes, it is increasingly important to catalogue biomarker variation across age groups and discover new biomarkers to distinguish chronological and biological aging.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of cardiocerebrovascular disease (CVD) is continuously increasing, and it is the leading cause of human death. Since it is difficult for physicians to screen thousands of people, high-accuracy and interpretable methods need to be presented. We developed four machine learning-based CVD classifiers (i.e., multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine, random forest, and light gradient boosting) based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We resampled and rebalanced KNHANES data using complex sampling weights such that the rebalanced dataset mimics a uniformly sampled dataset from overall population. For clear risk factor analysis, we removed multicollinearity and CVD-irrelevant variables using VIF-based filtering and the Boruta algorithm. We applied synthetic minority oversampling technique and random undersampling before ML training. We demonstrated that the proposed classifiers achieved excellent performance with AUCs over 0.853. Using Shapley value-based risk factor analysis, we identified that the most significant risk factors of CVD were age, sex, and the prevalence of hypertension. Additionally, we identified that age, hypertension, and BMI were positively correlated with CVD prevalence, while sex (female), alcohol consumption and, monthly income were negative. The results showed that the feature selection and the class balancing technique effectively improve the interpretability of models.},

	abstract = {Higher physical activity levels are associated with lower risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, but associations with many common and less severe health conditions are not known. These conditions impose large health care burdens and reduce quality of life.To investigate the association between accelerometer-measured physical activity and the subsequent risk of hospitalization for 25 common reasons for hospitalization and to estimate the proportion of these hospitalizations that might have been prevented if participants had higher levels of physical activity.This prospective cohort study used data from a subset of 81 717 UK Biobank participants aged 42 to 78 years. Participants wore an accelerometer for 1 week (between June 1, 2013, and December 23, 2015) and were followed up over a median (IQR) of 6.8 (6.2-7.3) years; follow-up for the current study ended in 2021 (exact date varied by location).Mean total and intensity-specific accelerometer-measured physical activity.Hospitalization for the most common health conditions. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% CIs for mean accelerometer-measured physical activity (per 1-SD increment) and risks of hospitalization for 25 conditions. Population-attributable risks were used to estimate the proportion of hospitalizations for each condition that might be prevented if participants increased their moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) by 20 minutes per day.Among 81 717 participants, the mean‚Äâ(SD) age at accelerometer assessment was 61.5 (7.9) years; 56.4\% were female, and 97.0\% self-identified as White. Higher levels of accelerometer-measured physical activity were associated with lower risks of hospitalization for 9 conditions: gallbladder disease (HR per 1 SD,‚Äâ0.74; 95\% CI, 0.69-0.79), urinary tract infections (HR per 1 SD, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.69-0.84), diabetes (HR per 1 SD, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.74-0.84), venous thromboembolism (HR per 1 SD, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.75-0.90), pneumonia (HR per 1 SD, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.77-0.89), ischemic stroke (HR per 1 SD, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.76-0.95), iron deficiency anemia (HR per 1 SD, 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.84-0.98), diverticular disease (HR per 1 SD, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.90-0.99), and colon polyps (HR per 1 SD, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.94-0.99). Positive associations were observed between overall physical activity and carpal tunnel syndrome (HR per 1 SD, 1.28; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.40), osteoarthritis (HR per 1 SD, 1.15; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.19), and inguinal hernia (HR per 1 SD, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.19), which were primarily induced by light physical activity. Increasing MVPA by 20 minutes per day was associated with reductions in hospitalization ranging from 3.8\% (95\% CI, 1.8\%-5.7\%) for colon polyps to 23.0\% (95\% CI, 17.1\%-28.9\%) for diabetes.In this cohort study of UK Biobank participants, those with higher physical activity levels had lower risks of hospitalization across a broad range of health conditions. These findings suggest that aiming to increase MVPA by 20 minutes per day may be a useful nonpharmaceutical intervention to reduce health care burdens and improve quality of life.},

	abstract = {Increased physical activity (PA) has been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. However, most previous studies use self-reported PA instead of objectively measured PA assessed by wearable accelerometers. To the best of our knowledge, there have not been studies that quantified the univariate and multivariate ability of objectively measured PA summaries to predict the risk of CVD mortality. We investigate the ability of objectively measured PA summary variables to predict CVD mortality: as individual predictors, as part of the best multivariate model incorporating traditional predictors, and as additions to the best multivariate model using only traditional CVD predictors. Data were collected in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003‚Äì2006 waves for US participants aged 50‚Äì85. The predictive ability was measured using Concordance, sometimes referred to as the C-statistic. Specifically, we calculated 10-fold cross-validated concordance (CVC) in survey-weighted Cox proportional hazard models. The best univariate predictor of CVD mortality was total activity count (outperformed age). In multivariate models, two of the eight predictors identified using the improvement in CVC threshold of 0.001 were PA measures (CVC¬†=¬†0.844). The best model without physical activity (7 predictors) had CVC of 0.830. The addition of PA measures to the best traditional model was significantly better at predicting CVD mortality (P¬†{\textless}¬†0.001). Accelerometer-derived PA measures have excellent cardiovascular mortality prediction performance. Wearable accelerometers have a potential for assessment of individuals' CVD mortality risks.},

	abstract = {C-reactive protein (CRP), a humoral component of the innate immune system with important functions in host-defense, is extensively used as a sensitive biomarker of systemic inflammation. During inflammation, hepatocyte-derived CRP rises dramatically in the blood due to increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Reliable detection of CRP in saliva, instead of blood, would offer advantages regarding sampling procedure and availability but using saliva as a diagnostic body fluid comes with challenges. The aims of this study were to evaluate associations between salivary CRP, total protein levels in saliva and serum CRP. Furthermore, we examined associations with plasma IL-6, body mass index (BMI), tobacco smoking and age. Salivary CRP was investigated by ELISA in 107 middle-aged participants from the general population. We employed spectrophotometric determination of total protein levels. Correlation analyses were used for associations of salivary CRP with serum CRP (turbidimetry), plasma IL-6 (Luminex¬Æ), BMI and smoking habits. Salivary median CRP was 68\% higher (p=0.009), and total protein levels were 167\% higher (p{\textless}0.0001), in morning compared to evening saliva. The correlation coefficients between serum and salivary CRP were low to moderate, but stronger for evening than morning saliva. Plasma IL-6 correlated significantly with serum CRP (rs=0.41, p{\textless}0.01), but not with morning or evening salivary CRP. Non-smokers showed 103\% higher salivary CRP levels (p=0.015), whereas serum CRP was independent of smoking status. As opposed to CRP in serum, salivary CRP was not associated with BMI. Salivary CRP was 90\% higher among the age interval 60‚Äì69 years compared to subjects aged 45‚Äì59 (p=0.02) while serum CRP levels did not differ between the age groups. In conclusion, CRP in saliva did not straightforwardly reflect serum concentrations. This raises questions regarding adequate reflection of biological events. The pronounced diurnal salivary CRP pattern accentuates the importance of standardizing the time-point of sampling.},

No known study has investigated the association between salivary biomarkers and perceptions of swallowing in individuals with SS. Our objectives were to explore: (1) the operational feasibility of investigating saliva volume and composition, along with perceptions of swallowing, in those with and without SS; and (2) the relationship between saliva composition and perceptions of oral dryness, swallowing, and quality of life. Methods We conducted a prospective, case‚Äìcontrol feasibility study, collecting feasibility data (recruitment rate and optimal saliva collection methods) and whole mouth saliva samples (unstimulated and stimulated). We measured total protein content and conducted sialochemical (Œ±-amylase, cortisol, C-reactive protein [CRP], and mucins), sialometric (flow rate), and perceptual (oral dryness and swallowing-related quality of life [SWAL-QOL]) assessments. Our exploratory analyses focused on the main and fixed effects. We summarized all data descriptively, comparing: (a) outcomes between groups (t tests or Mann‚ÄìWhitney U) and (b) salivary and perceptual data across participants (partial least-squares correlation [PLSC]). Results We enrolled 12 (N) participants (6 per group), all providing analyzable saliva. Cases had lower flow rate (p = 0.003) and higher total protein, cortisol, and CRP concentrations (p {\textless} 0.02) than controls. PLSC revealed inverse covariance between sialochemical and SWAL-QOL data across participants. Conclusion Our study was feasible as designed. We explored novel relationships between salivary outcomes and participant-reported perceptions, distinguishing individuals with and without SS. Our findings support further study of saliva's role in perceptions of swallowing, specifically analytes with lubricative properties.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing interest in using saliva to measure inflammatory biomarkers. Compared to blood, saliva is non-invasive, requires a lower biosafety classification, and requires less specialized personnel to collect. As the assessment of inflammation in saliva becomes more popular in psychoneuroimmunology research, the development of gold-standard methodological practices is paramount. This paper reviews different considerations for designing studies to assess salivary measures of inflammation. We review saliva collection procedures, sample storage and processing considerations, assay techniques, flow rate, correspondence with blood-based markers, and potential demographic and health moderators of levels of salivary markers of inflammation. Together, this review highlights critical gaps for future research, including calls for standardization of study protocols, transparent reporting of results, assessing predictive validity of markers of salivary inflammation for disease, and the need for assessment of participants‚Äô oral and general health status. Although additional work is needed to elucidate gold standards for study design, measurement, and analysis, salivary markers of inflammation may be a useful tool for understanding oral and peripheral inflammation dynamics non-invasively.},

We performed a genome wide association on the accelerated aging phenotypes to estimate its heritability (h\_g2 = 12.3¬±0.9\%) and identified ten single nucleotide polymorphisms in close proximity to genes in a histone and olfactory cluster on chromosome six (e.g HIST1H1C, OR5V1). Similarly, we identified biomarkers (e.g blood pressure), clinical phenotypes (e.g chest pain), diseases (e.g hypertension), environmental (e.g smoking), and socioeconomic (e.g income and education) variables associated with accelerated aging.

	abstract = {Background

Current physical activity guidelines focus on volume and intensity for CVD prevention rather than common behaviors responsible for movement, including those for daily living activities. We examined the associations of a machine‚Äêlearned, accelerometer‚Äêmeasured behavior termed daily life movement (DLM) with incident CVD.

Methods and Results

Older women (n=5416; mean age, 79¬±7¬†years; 33\% Black, 17\% Hispanic) in the Women‚Äôs Health Initiative OPACH (Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health) study without prior CVD wore ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers for up to 7¬†days from May 2012 to April 2014 and were followed for physician‚Äêadjudicated incident CVD through February 28th, 2020 (n=616 events). DLM was defined as standing and moving in a confined space such as performing housework or gardening. Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% CI, adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, education, alcohol use, smoking, multimorbidity, self‚Äêrated health, and physical function. Restricted cubic splines examined the linearity of the DLM‚ÄêCVD dose‚Äêresponse association. We examined effect modification by age, body mass index, Reynolds Risk Score, and race and ethnicity. Adjusted HR (95\% CIs) across DLM quartiles were: 1.00 (reference), 0.68 (0.55‚Äì0.84), 0.70 (0.56‚Äì0.87), and 0.57 (0.45‚Äì0.74); p‚Äêtrend{\textless}0.001. The HR (95\% CI) for each 1‚Äêhour increment in DLM was 0.86 (0.80‚Äì0.92) with evidence of a linear dose‚Äêresponse association (p non‚Äêlinear{\textgreater}0.09). There was no evidence of effect modification by age, body mass index, Reynolds Risk Score, or race and ethnicity.

Conclusions

Higher DLM was independently associated with a lower risk of CVD in older women. Describing the beneficial associations of physical activity in terms of common behaviors could help older adults accumulate physical activity.},

	abstract = {Nationwide population-based cohort provides a new opportunity to build an automated risk prediction model based on individuals‚Äô history of health and healthcare beyond existing risk prediction models. We tested the possibility of machine learning models to predict future incidence of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) using large-scale administrative health data. From the Korean National Health Insurance Service database between 2002 and 2010, we obtained de-identified health data in elders above 65 years (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ40,736) containing 4,894 unique clinical features including ICD-10 codes, medication codes, laboratory values, history of personal and family illness and socio-demographics. To define incident AD we considered two operational definitions: ‚Äúdefinite AD‚Äù with diagnostic codes and dementia medication (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ614) and ‚Äúprobable AD‚Äù with only diagnosis (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ2026). We trained and validated random forest, support vector machine and logistic regression to predict incident AD in 1, 2, 3, and 4 subsequent years. For predicting future incidence of AD in balanced samples (bootstrapping), the machine learning models showed reasonable performance in 1-year prediction with AUC of 0.775 and 0.759, based on ‚Äúdefinite AD‚Äù and ‚Äúprobable AD‚Äù outcomes, respectively; in 2-year, 0.730 and 0.693; in 3-year, 0.677 and 0.644; in 4-year, 0.725 and 0.683. The results were similar when the entire (unbalanced) samples were used. Important clinical features selected in logistic regression included hemoglobin level, age and urine protein level. This study may shed a light on the utility of the data-driven machine learning model based on large-scale administrative health data in AD risk prediction, which may enable better selection of individuals at risk for AD in clinical trials or early detection in clinical settings.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between long working hours and the 10-year-risk of CHD and stroke, estimated by Jee's health risk-appraisal model for ischemic heart disease.
METHODS: We analyzed data from Koreans who randomly enrolled in Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008-2012 and finally included 13,799 participants. The participants were classified as per their working hours: 0-30¬†h/week, 31-39¬†h/week, 40¬†h/week, 41-50¬†h/week, 51-60¬†h/week, 61-70¬†h/week, 71-80¬†h/week, and {\textgreater}80¬†h/week. The risks for CHD and stroke were determined using Jee's health risk-appraisal model. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the association between working hours and 10-year risk for CHD.
RESULTS: The 10-year risks for CHD and stroke were significantly and positively associated with working hours in both men and women. Furthermore, higher risks for CHD and stroke were associated with longer working hours in women.
CONCLUSION: Long working hours are significantly associated with the risks of CHD and stroke, estimated by Jee's health risk-appraisal model. This study suggests the need for proper management of working hours to reduce CHD risk and stroke risk in the Korean population.},

Recent national data suggest there were improvements in serum lipid concentrations among US children and adolescents between 1988 and 2010 but an increase in or stable blood pressure (BP) during a similar period.

OBJECTIVE
To describe the prevalence of and trends in dyslipidemia and adverse BP among US children and adolescents.

DESIGN
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional survey.

SETTING
Noninstitutionalized US population.

PARTICIPANTS
Children and adolescents aged 8 to 17 years with measured lipid concentrations (n = 1482) and BP (n = 1665).

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Adverse concentrations of total cholesterol (TC) (‚â•200 mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ({\textless}40 mg/dL), and non-HDL-C (‚â•145 mg/dL) (to convert TC, HDL-C, and non-HDL-C to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) and high or borderline BP were examined. Definitions of BP were informed by the Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents. Analyses of linear trends in dyslipidemias and BP were conducted overall and separately by sex across 7 periods (1999‚Äì2000, 2001‚Äì2002, 2003‚Äì2004, 2005‚Äì2006, 2007‚Äì2008, 2009‚Äì2010, and 2011‚Äì2012).

RESULTS
In 2011‚Äì2012, 20.2\% (95\% CI, 16.3‚Äì24.6) of youths had an adverse concentration of TC, HDL-C, or non-HDL-C and 11.0\% (95\% CI, 8.8‚Äì13.4) had either high or borderline BP. The prevalences of adverse concentrations decreased between 1999‚Äì2000 and 2011‚Äì2012 for TC (10.6\% [95\% CI, 8.3‚Äì13.2] vs 7.8\% [95\% CI, 5.7‚Äì10.4]; P = .006), HDL-C (17.9\% [95\% CI, 15.0‚Äì21.0] vs 12.8\% [95\% CI, 9.8‚Äì16.2]; P = .003), and non-HDL-C (13.6\% [95\% CI, 11.3‚Äì16.2] vs 8.4\% [95\% CI, 5.9‚Äì11.5]; P {\textless} .001). There was a decrease in high BP between 1999‚Äì2000 (3.0\% [95\% CI, 2.0‚Äì4.3]) and 2011‚Äì2012 (1.6\% [95\% CI, 1.0‚Äì2.4]) (P = .003). There was no change from 1999‚Äì2000 to 2011‚Äì2012 in borderline high BP (7.6\% [95\% CI, 5.8‚Äì9.8] vs 9.4\% [95\% CI, 7.2‚Äì11.9]; P = .90) or either high or borderline high BP (10.6\% [8.4‚Äì13.1] vs 11.0\% [95\% CI, 8.8‚Äì13.4]; P = .26).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
In 2011‚Äì2012, approximately 1 in 5 children and adolescents aged 8 to 17 years had an adverse lipid concentration of TC, HDL-C, or non-HDL-C and slightly more than 1 in 10 had either borderline high or high BP. The prevalence of dyslipidemia modestly decreased between 1999‚Äì2000 and 2011‚Äì2012, but either high or borderline high BP remained stable. The reasons for these trends require further study.},

	abstract = {Background
Because family history is a known risk factor for heart disease, it is important to characterize its public health impact in terms of population prevalence of family history of heart disease, the burden of heart disease attributable to family history, and whether family history interacts with modifiable risk factors for heart disease.

Methods and Results
We used population data from NHANES (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [2007‚Äì2014]) to measure the association of self‚Äêreported family history of premature heart disease (FHPHD) with cardiovascular disease (n=19¬†253) and to examine the association between cardiovascular health metrics and FHPHD (n=16¬†248). Using logistic regression and multivariable adjustment, family history odds ratios were 5.91 (95\% CI, 3.34‚Äì10.44) for ages 20 to 39, 3.02 (95\% CI, 2.41‚Äì3.79) for ages 40 to 59, and 1.87 (95\% CI, 1.54‚Äì2.28) for age ‚â•60 for cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease for the population with a FHPHD (15.72\%; 95\% CI, 13.81‚Äì17.64) was more than double the prevalence of cardiovascular disease for those without a family history (6.25\%; 95\% CI, 5.82‚Äì6.69). Compared with participants with optimum cardiovascular health, the prevalence ratio for FHPHD was 1.98 (95\% CI, 1.40‚Äì2.79) for those with inadequate cardiovascular health.

Conclusions
Millions of people who are at high risk of having cardiovascular disease could be identified using FHPHD. FHPHD can become an important component of public health campaigns that address modifiable risk factors that plan to reduce the overall risk of heart disease.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to describe the volume and patterns of objectively assessed sedentary behaviour, light intensity physical activity (LPA) and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and to examine socio-demographic correlates, among adults living with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Participants (n = 166) wore an accelerometer (Actigraph¬Æ GT3X+) for seven consecutive days during waking hours and completed a questionnaire. Physical activity (PA) and sedentary time were described, and multivariable linear regression was used to estimate associations between socio-demographic characteristics and sedentary time and PA. RESULTS Participants, 46\% of whom were female, had a mean age of 65.4 years (standard deviation (SD) = 9.5), body mass index (BMI) of 31.5 (6.6) kg/m2 and had been living with diabetes for an average of 13.1 (7.6) years. Participants were sedentary for 543.6 minutes/day, spent 273.4 minutes/day and 22.4 minutes/day in LPA and MVPA respectively. BMI was associated with increased sedentary time and reduced LPA (‚àí2.5 minutes/day, 95\% CI: ‚àí4.33 to ‚àí0.70) and MVPA (‚àí0.62 minutes/day, 95\% CI: ‚àí1.05 to ‚àí0.18) time. Compared with males, females had more LPA (34.4 minutes/day, 95\% CI: 10.21‚Äì58.49) and less MVPA (‚àí6.2 minutes/day, 95\% CI: ‚àí12.04 to ‚àí0.41) time. Unemployed participants had 30.05 minutes more MVPA (95\% CI: 3.35‚Äì56.75) than those who were employed or homemakers, and those not reporting income had 13 minutes/day more MVPA time than participants in the lowest income category (95\% CI: 3.46‚Äì22.40). CONCLUSION Adults living with type 2 diabetes were not sufficiently active and were highly sedentary. Our results emphasize the need for more research exploring the diabetes-related health outcomes of sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity among people living with type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {Evidence suggests potential links between circadian rhythm and atrial fibrillation (AF). However, whether circadian disruption can predict the onset of AF in the general population remains largely unknown. We aim to investigate the association of accelerometer-measured circadian rest-activity rhythm (CRAR, the most prominent circadian rhythm in humans) with the risk of AF, and examine joint associations and potential interactions of CRAR and genetic susceptibility with AF incidence. We include 62,927 white British participants of UK Biobank without AF at baseline. CRAR characteristics, including amplitude (strength), acrophase (timing of peak activity), pseudo-F (robustness), and mesor (height), are derived by applying an extended cosine model. Genetic risk is assessed with polygenic risk scores. The outcome is the incidence of AF. During a median follow-up of 6.16 years, 1920 participants developed AF. Low amplitude [hazard ratio (HR): 1.41, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.25‚Äì1.58], delayed acrophase (HR: 1.24, 95\% CI: 1.10‚Äì1.39), and low mesor (HR: 1.36, 95\% CI: 1.21‚Äì1.52), but not low pseudo-F, are significantly associated with a higher risk of AF. No significant interactions between CRAR characteristics and genetic risk are observed. Joint association analyses reveal that participants with unfavourable CRAR characteristics and high genetic risk yield the highest risk of incident AF. These associations are robust after controlling for multiple testing and in a series of sensitivity analyses. Accelerometer-measured CRAR abnormalities, characterized by decreased strength and height, and later timing of peak activity of circadian rhythm, are associated with a higher risk of AF in the general population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Higher levels of physical activity (PA) are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, uncertainty exists on whether the inverse relationship between PA and incidence of CVD is greater at the highest levels of PA. Past studies have mostly relied on self-reported evidence from questionnaire-based PA, which is crude and cannot capture all PA undertaken. We investigated the association between accelerometer-measured moderate, vigorous, and total PA and incident CVD.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We obtained accelerometer-measured moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity physical activities and total volume of PA, over a 7-day period in 2013-2015, for 90,211 participants without prior or concurrent CVD in the UK Biobank cohort. Participants in the lowest category of total PA smoked more, had higher body mass index and C-reactive protein, and were diagnosed with hypertension. PA was associated with 3,617 incident CVD cases during 440,004 person-years of follow-up (median (interquartile range [IQR]): 5.2 (1.2) years) using Cox regression models. We found a linear dose-response relationship for PA, whether measured as moderate-intensity, vigorous-intensity, or as total volume, with risk of incident of CVD. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals for increasing quarters of the PA distribution relative to the lowest fourth were for moderate-intensity PA: 0.71 (0.65, 0.77), 0.59 (0.54, 0.65), and 0.46 (0.41, 0.51); for vigorous-intensity PA: 0.70 (0.64, 0.77), 0.54 (0.49,0.59), and 0.41 (0.37,0.46); and for total volume of PA: 0.73 (0.67, 0.79), 0.63 (0.57, 0.69), and 0.47 (0.43, 0.52). We took account of potential confounders but unmeasured confounding remains a possibility, and while removal of early deaths did not affect the estimated HRs, we cannot completely dismiss the likelihood that reverse causality has contributed to the findings. Another possible limitation of this work is the quantification of PA intensity-levels based on methods validated in relatively small studies.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found no evidence of a threshold for the inverse association between objectively measured moderate, vigorous, and total PA with CVD. Our findings suggest that PA is not only associated with lower risk for of CVD, but the greatest benefit is seen for those who are active at the highest level.},

Methods Progetto Veneto Anziani (Pro.V.A.) is a cohort study of 3099 Italians aged ‚â•65 years with baseline assessment in 1995‚Äì1997 and follow-up visits at 4 and 7 years. Surveillance was extended to 2018 by linkage with hospital and mortality records. Prevalent and incident cardiovascular diseases (coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke) were identified through clinical examination, questionnaire, or hospital records. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was considered as a time-varying variable. Physical activity trajectories were categorised as: stable-low, high-decreasing, low-increasing and stable-high. Exposure was also assessed at 70, 75, 80 and 85 years.
Results Overall, physical activity was associated with lower rates of incident cardiovascular diseases. A significant risk reduction was present among men and was stronger earlier in late life (70‚Äì75 years). Trajectories of stable-high physical activity were associated with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes among men (HR 0.48, 95\% CI 0.27 to 0.86) compared with those with stable-low trajectories (p for trend 0.002). No significant association was found with stroke. The greatest cardiovascular risk reduction was observed for {\textgreater}20 min/day of physical activity, and was more marked at 70 years.
Conclusion Increasingly active trajectories of physical activity were associated with lower rates of cardiovascular diseases and overall mortality. Promoting at least 20 min/day of physical activity early in late life seems to provide the greatest cardiovascular benefits.},

	abstract = {Background Acute leukaemias (AL) are aggressive but potentially curable blood cancers that can potentially affect women of childbearing age. When a pregnancy is complicated by a diagnosis of AL, clinicians face a complex dilemma: to balance risking the mother‚Äôs survival through delayed AL treatment, against the potential harm to the foetus through exposure to anti-cancer drugs. Up until now, all guidance and advice regarding the management of AL in pregnancy, have been based on expert opinion and small case studies. There is a pressing need for more studies in the subject to address this evidence gap. Methods and analysis This study is a registry-based observational cohort study which aims to monitor and record the treatment outcomes of patients diagnosed with AL during pregnancy. Additionally, the study aims to assess pregnancy outcomes in patients who become pregnant following successful treatment. Prospective and historical cases from August 2009 onwards will be identified from AL treating haematology units within the UK. Details of diagnosis, AL treatment delivered, antenatal and postnatal outcomes for mother and neonate will be collected. This study will establish a new research database for Leukaemia in Pregnancy. Trial registration The study was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04182074) on the 2nd December 2019.},

	abstract = {Background Mental health services for adults, as they are currently configured, have been designed to provide predominantly community-based interventions. It has long been recognised that some patients have such significant clinical and/or risk needs that those needs cannot be adequately met within standard service delivery models, resulting in a pressing need to consider the best models for this group of people. This paper shares a protocol for a mixed methods study that aims to understand: the profile and history of service users described as having complex needs; the decision-making processes by clinicians that lead to complex needs categorisation; service users and carers experience of service use; and, associated economic impact. This protocol describes a comprehensive evaluation that aims to inform an evidence-based service delivery model for people with complex needs. Methods We will use a mixed methods design, combining quantitative and qualitative methods using in-depth descriptive and inferential analysis of patient records, written medical notes and in-depth interviews with service users, carers, and clinicians. The study will include five components: (1) a quantitative description and analysis of the demographic clinical characteristics of the patient group; (2) an economic evaluation of alternative patient pathways; (3) semi-structured interviews about service user and carer experiences; (4) using data from components 1‚Äì3 to co-produce vignettes jointly with relevant stakeholders involved in the care of service users with complex mental health needs; and, (5) semi-structured interviews about clinical decision-making by clinicians in relation to this patient group, using the vignettes as example case studies. Discussion The study‚Äôs key outcomes will be to: examine the resource use and cost-impact associated with alternative care pathways to the NHS and other sectors of the economy (including social care); explore patient health and non-health outcomes associated with alternative care pathways; and, gain an understanding of a complex service user group and how treatment decisions are made to inform consistent and person-centred future service delivery.},

	abstract = {Objectives Non-publication and publication bias are topics of considerable importance to the scientific community. These issues may limit progress toward the 3R principle for animal research, promote waste of public resources, and generate biased interpretations of clinical outcomes. To investigate current publishing practices and to gain some understanding of the extent to which research results are reported, we examined publication rates of research projects that were approved within an internal funding program of the Faculty of Medicine at a university medical center in Germany, which is exemplary for comparable research funding programs for the promotion of young researchers in Germany and Europe. Methods We analyzed the complete set (n = 363) of research projects that were supported by an internal funding program between 2004 and 2013. We divided the projects into four different proposal types that included those that required an ethics vote, those that included an animal proposal, those that included both requirements, and those that included neither requirement. Results We found that 65\% of the internally funded research projects resulted in at least one peer-reviewed publication; this increased to 73\% if other research contributions were considered, including abstracts, book and congress contributions, scientific posters, and presentations. There were no significant differences with respect to publication rates based on (a) the clinic/institute of the applicant, (b) project duration, (c) scope of funding or (d) proposal type. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore publication rates associated with early-career medical research funding. As {\textgreater}70\% of the projects ultimately generated some form of publication, the program was overall effective toward this goal; however, non-publication of research results is still prevalent. Further research will explore the reasons underlying non-publication. We hope to use these findings to develop strategies that encourage publication of research results.},

	abstract = {C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute inflammatory protein that increases up to 1,000-fold at sites of infection or inflammation. CRP is produced as a homopentameric protein, termed native CRP (nCRP), which can irreversibly dissociate at sites of inflammation and infection into five separate monomers, termed monomeric CRP (mCRP). CRP is synthesized primarily in liver hepatocytes but also by smooth muscle cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, lymphocytes, and adipocytes. Evidence suggests that estrogen in the form of hormone replacement therapy influences CRP levels in the elderly. Having been traditionally utilized as a marker of infection and cardiovascular events, there is now growing evidence that CRP plays important roles in inflammatory processes and host responses to infection including the complement pathway, apoptosis, phagocytosis, nitric oxide (NO) release, and the production of cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Œ±. Unlike more recent publications, the findings of early work on CRP can seem somewhat unclear and at times conflicting since it was often not specified which particular CRP isoform was measured or utilized in experiments and whether responses attributed to nCRP were in fact possibly due to dissociation into mCRP or lipopolysaccharide contamination. In addition, since antibodies for mCRP are not commercially available, few laboratories are able to conduct studies investigating the mCRP isoform. Despite these issues and the fact that most CRP research to date has focused on vascular disorders, there is mounting evidence that CRP isoforms have distinct biological properties, with nCRP often exhibiting more anti-inflammatory activities compared to mCRP. The nCRP isoform activates the classical complement pathway, induces phagocytosis, and promotes apoptosis. On the other hand, mCRP promotes the chemotaxis and recruitment of circulating leukocytes to areas of inflammation and can delay apoptosis. The nCRP and mCRP isoforms work in opposing directions to inhibit and induce NO production, respectively. In terms of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, mCRP increases interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production, whereas nCRP has no detectable effect on their levels. Further studies are needed to expand on these emerging findings and to fully characterize the differential roles that each CRP isoform plays at sites of local inflammation and infection.},

Our retrained principal-component versions of six clocks show agreement between most replicates within 1.5 years, improved detection of clock associations and intervention effects, and reliable longitudinal trajectories in vivo and in vitro. This method entails only one additional step compared to traditional clocks, requires no replicates or prior knowledge of CpG reliabilities for training, and can be applied to any existing or future epigenetic biomarker. The high reliability of principal component-based clocks is critical for applications to personalized medicine, longitudinal tracking, in vitro studies, and clinical trials of aging interventions.},

	abstract = {Background
A new digital peak flow meter, known as Smart Peak Flow (SPF), has been developed to
monitor asthma patients‚Äô peak expiratory flow (PEF) at home. It is connected wirelessly
to any type of smartphone and it is used by asthma patients to self-monitor progress of
their clinical condition. Thus evaluation of the SPF‚Äôs ability to provide accurate PEF
values is essential. The aim of this pilot work was to provide preliminary in-vivo data
about the measurement agreement between the SPF and a lab spirometer for a first
time.

Methods
PEF measurements were obtained by 9 healthy adults as this pilot work was terminated
earlier than it was expected due to COVID-19 restrictions. PEF readings (n=27) were
recorded by the comparable devices at the same time during three different expiratory
maneuvers performed by each participant. The Bland and Altman plot was used to assess
the agreement.

Results
Good agreement between the SPF and the lab spirometer was found with the mean bias
being estimated 0.29 L/min. The lower and upper limits of agreement (LOA) were estimated
30.03 L/min and ‚àí30.61 L/min respectively.

Conclusion
Due to a small sample size, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the SPF‚Äôs
accuracy. However the current promising results encourage further testing in the
future.},

	abstract = {Background
The study evaluates and compares the accuracy of nine peak flow meters (‚ÄúPFMs‚Äù) and spirometers that are currently available in Europe and have Conformit√© Europ√©ene (‚ÄúCE‚Äù) marking. The CE marking is a manufacturer‚Äôs declaration that their product complies with European health regulations and it is a requirement for marketing medical devices in Europe.

Methods
The nine devices were selected as they all had received or were in the process of receiving CE approval in Europe and were readily obtainable. The devices were bench tested following the ISO 23747:2015 accuracy guidelines for medical devices measuring peak flow. All standards, including accuracy, from these guidelines must be met to obtain CE marking., This study was performed with a certified piston pump testing apparatus. The apparatus chosen was the pulmonary waveform generator manufactured by Piston Medical Ltd. Using predefined flow (time) and volume (time) waveforms, peak flow meters and spirometers were tested for validation and calibration. Three CE guideline tests were utilised, and standards require that all three tests are passed for the device to obtain certification.

Results
Of the nine devices that were tested, two passed and seven failed. The devices that passed the tests were the Smart Peak Flow¬Æ and the Mini Wright¬Æ.

Conclusions
A high percentage of devices failed accuracy testing in this study. This is a concern as the CE marking is a manufacturer‚Äôs certification documenting the accuracy, reliability and safety of devices. Of the seven devices that failed all have the CE marking. All tested devices are on the market in Europe based upon studies conducted by each of the manufacturers. The data used to obtain CE certification of these devices, however, are not in the public domain.},

The most commonly used DNAm microarray, the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K array), has recently been replaced by the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC (EPIC array), nearly doubling the number of targeted CpG sites. Given that a subset of 450K CpG sites is absent on the EPIC array and that several tools for both data normalization and analyses were developed on the 450K array, it is important to assess their utility when applied to EPIC array data. One of the most commonly used 450K tools is the pan-tissue epigenetic clock, a multivariate predictor of biological age based on DNAm at 353 CpG sites. Of these CpGs, 19 are missing from the EPIC array, thus raising the question of whether EPIC data can be used to accurately estimate DNAm age. We also investigated a 71-CpG epigenetic age predictor, referred to as the Hannum method, which lacks 6 probes on the EPIC array. To evaluate these epigenetic clocks in EPIC data properly, a prior assessment of the effects of data preprocessing methods on DNAm age is also required.},

	abstract = {It was unknown whether plasma protein levels can be estimated based on DNA methylation (DNAm) levels, and if so, how the resulting surrogates can be consolidated into a powerful predictor of lifespan. We present here, seven DNAm-based estimators of plasma proteins including those of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and growth differentiation factor 15. The resulting predictor of lifespan, DNAm GrimAge (in units of years), is a composite biomarker based on the seven DNAm surrogates and a DNAm-based estimator of smoking pack-years. Adjusting DNAm GrimAge for chronological age generated novel measure of epigenetic age acceleration, AgeAccelGrim., Using large scale validation data from thousands of individuals, we demonstrate that DNAm GrimAge stands out among existing epigenetic clocks in terms of its predictive ability for time-to-death (Cox regression P=2.0E-75), time-to-coronary heart disease (Cox P=6.2E-24), time-to-cancer (P= 1.3E-12), its strong relationship with computed tomography data for fatty liver/excess visceral fat, and age-at-menopause (P=1.6E-12). AgeAccelGrim is strongly associated with a host of age-related conditions including comorbidity count (P=3.45E-17). Similarly, age-adjusted DNAm PAI-1 levels are associated with lifespan (P=5.4E-28), comorbidity count (P= 7.3E-56) and type 2 diabetes (P=2.0E-26). These DNAm-based biomarkers show the expected relationship with lifestyle factors including healthy diet and educational attainment., Overall, these epigenetic biomarkers are expected to find many applications including human anti-aging studies.},

We quantified biological aging from 4 DNAm ‚Äúclocks‚Äù (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and GrimAge clock), a DNAm pace-of-aging measure (DunedinPoAm), and 3 blood-chemistry measures (PhenoAge, Klemera-Doubal method biological age, and homeostatic dysregulation). We quantified Black-White disparities in healthspan from cross-sectional and longitudinal data on physical performance tests, self-reported limitations in activities of daily living, and physician-diagnosed chronic diseases, self-rated health, and survival. DNAm and blood-chemistry quantifications of biological aging were moderately correlated (Pearson‚Äôs r = 0.1‚Äì0.4). The GrimAge clock, DunedinPoAm, and all 3 blood-chemistry measures were associated with healthspan characteristics (e.g., mortality effect-size hazard ratios were 1.71‚Äì2.32 per standard deviation of biological aging) and showed evidence of more advanced/faster biological aging in Black participants than in White participants (Cohen‚Äôs d = 0.4‚Äì0.5). These measures accounted for 13\%‚Äì95\% of Black-White differences in healthspan-related characteristics. Findings suggest that reducing disparities in biological aging can contribute to building health equity.},

	abstract = {Age-related changes in DNA methylation were observed in cross-sectional studies, but longitudinal evidence is still limited. Here, we aimed to characterize longitudinal age-related methylation patterns using 1011 blood samples collected from 385 Swedish twins (age at entry: mean 69 and standard deviation 9.7, 73 monozygotic and 96 dizygotic pairs) up to five times (mean 2.6) over 20 years (mean 8.7). We identified 1316 age-associated methylation sites (P{\textless}1.3√ó10-7) using a longitudinal epigenome-wide association study design. We measured how estimated cellular compositions changed with age and how much they confounded the age effect. We validated the results in two independent longitudinal cohorts, where 118 CpGs were replicated in Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS, 390 samples) (P{\textless}3.9√ó10-5), 594 in Lothian Birth Cohort (LBC, 3018 samples) (P{\textless}5.1√ó10-5) and 63 in both. Functional annotation of age-associated CpGs showed enrichment in CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and other transcription factor binding sites. We further investigated genetic influences on methylation and found no interaction between age and genetic effects in the 1316 age-associated CpGs. Moreover, in the same CpGs, methylation differences within twin pairs increased with 6.4\% over 10 years, where monozygotic twins had smaller intra-pair differences than dizygotic twins. In conclusion, we show that age-related methylation changes persist in a longitudinal perspective, and are fairly stable across cohorts. The changes are under genetic influence, although this effect is independent of age. Moreover, methylation variability increase over time, especially in age-associated CpGs, indicating the increase of environmental contributions on DNA methylation with age.},

	abstract = {Epigenetic clocks can track both chronological age (cAge) and biological age (bAge). The latter is typically defined by physiological biomarkers and risk of adverse health outcomes, including all-cause mortality. As cohort sample sizes increase, estimates of cAge and bAge become more precise. Here, we aim to refine predictors and improve understanding of the epigenomic architecture of cAge and bAge. First, we perform large-scale (N = 18,413) epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of chronological age and all-cause mortality. Next, to improve cAge prediction, we use methylation data from 24,673 participants from the Generation Scotland (GS) study, the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936 and 8 publicly available datasets. Through the inclusion of linear and non-linear age-CpG associations from the EWAS, feature pre-selection/dimensionality reduction in advance of elastic net regression, and a leave-one-cohort-out (LOCO) cross validation framework, we arrive at an improved cAge predictor (median absolute error = 2.3 years across 10 cohorts). In addition, we train a predictor of bAge on 1,214 all-cause mortality events in GS, based on epigenetic surrogates for 109 plasma proteins and the 8 component parts of GrimAge, the current best epigenetic predictor of all-cause mortality. We test this predictor in four external cohorts (LBC1921, LBC1936, the Framingham Heart Study and the Women‚Äôs Health Initiative study) where it outperforms GrimAge in its association to survival (HRGrimAge = 1.47 [1.40, 1.54] with p = 1.08 √ó 10‚àí52, and HRbAge = 1.52 [1.44, 1.59] with p = 2.20 √ó 10‚àí60).

	abstract = {The lack of exact definition of the concept of biological age (BA) is a typical feature of works concerning BA. That is why comparison of results of various published methods makes little sense and eventual proof of their optimality is impossible. Based on natural and simple presumptions, an attempt to express mathematically the supposed relation between chronological age (CA) and BA has proven to be unexpectedly fruitful. In the present paper, an optimum method of estimation of BA, which is easily applicable even in nonlinear cases, is derived. Moreover, the method allows evaluating the precision of the estimates and also offers tools for validation of presumptions of the method. A special feature of the method is that CA should be used as a standard biomarker, leading to essential improving the precision of BA-estimate and illuminating relativity of the known ‚Äúparadox of biomarkers‚Äù. All theoretical results of the method were fully approved by means of a special simulation program. Further, the theory and the results of the simulation have proven that many published results of BA-estimates using multiple linear regression (MLR) are very probably disserviceable because CA is typically more precise estimate of BA than estimates computed by MLR. This unpleasant conclusion also concerns methods, which use MLR as the final step after transformation of the battery of biomarkers by factor analysis or by principal component analysis.},

	abstract = {The absence of comparative validity studies has prevented researchers from reaching consensus regarding the application of intensity-related accelerometer cut points for children and adolescents.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the classification accuracy of five sets of independently developed ActiGraph cut points using energy expenditure, measured by indirect calorimetry, as a criterion reference standard.
METHODS: A total of 206 participants between the ages of 5 and 15 yr completed 12 standardized activity trials. Trials consisted of sedentary activities (lying down, writing, computer game), lifestyle activities (sweeping, laundry, throw and catch, aerobics, basketball), and ambulatory activities (comfortable walk, brisk walk, brisk treadmill walk, running). During each trial, participants wore an ActiGraph GT1M, and VÀôO2 was measured breath-by-breath using the Oxycon Mobile portable metabolic system. Physical activity intensity was estimated using five independently developed cut points: Freedson/Trost (FT), Puyau (PU), Treuth (TR), Mattocks (MT), and Evenson (EV). Classification accuracy was evaluated via weighted Œ∫ statistics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC).
RESULTS: Across all four intensity levels, the EV (Œ∫=0.68) and FT (Œ∫=0.66) cut points exhibited significantly better agreement than TR (Œ∫=0.62), MT (Œ∫=0.54), and PU (Œ∫=0.36). The EV and FT cut points exhibited significantly better classification accuracy for moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (ROC-AUC=0.90) than TR, PU, or MT cut points (ROC-AUC=0.77-0.85). Only the EV cut points provided acceptable classification accuracy for all four levels of physical activity intensity and performed well among children of all ages. The widely applied sedentary cut point of 100 counts per minute exhibited excellent classification accuracy (ROC-AUC=0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these findings, we recommend that researchers use the EV ActiGraph cut points to estimate time spent in sedentary, light-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity activity in children and adolescents.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We examined total activity, light activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as predictors of mortality in a nationally representative sample of older adults. Then we explored the theoretical consequences of replacing sedentary time with the same duration of light activity or MVPA.
METHODS: Using accelerometer-measured activity, the associations between total activity, light activity (100-2019 counts per minute), and MVPA ({\textgreater}2019 counts per minute) counts and mortality were examined in adults age 50 to 79 yr in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003-2006 (n = 3029), with mortality follow-up through December 2011. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to estimate mortality risks. An isotemporal substitution model was used to examine the theoretical consequences of replacing sedentary time with light activity or MVPA on mortality.
RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, BMI, and the presence of comorbid conditions, those in the highest tertile of total activity counts had one fifth the risk of death of those in the lowest tertile (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.21, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.12-0.38), and those in the middle tertile had one third the risk of death (HR = 0.36, 95\% CI = 0.30-0.44). In addition, replacing 30 min of sedentary time with light activity was associated with significant reduction in mortality risk (after 5 yr of follow-up: HR = 0.80, 95\% CI = 0.75-0.85). Replacing 30 min of sedentary time with MVPA was also associated with reduction in mortality risk (HR = 0.49, 95\% CI = 0.25-0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Greater total activity is associated with lower all-cause mortality risk. Replacing sedentary time with light activity or MVPA may reduce mortality risk for older adults.},

	abstract = {Recent attention has highlighted the importance of reducing sedentary time for maintaining health and quality of life. However, it is unclear how changing sedentary behavior may influence executive functions and self-regulatory strategy use, which are vital for the long-term maintenance of a health behavior regimen. The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to examine the estimated self-regulatory and executive functioning effects of substituting 30¬†min of sedentary behavior with 30¬†min of light activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), or sleep in a sample of older adults. This study reports baseline data collected from low-active healthy older adults (N¬†=¬†247, mean age 65.4¬†¬±¬†4.6¬†years) recruited to participate in a 6¬†month randomized controlled exercise trial examining the effects of various modes of exercise on brain health and function. Each participant completed assessments of physical activity self-regulatory strategy use (i.e., self-monitoring, goal-setting, social support, reinforcement, time management, and relapse prevention) and executive functioning. Physical activity and sedentary behaviors were measured using accelerometers during waking hours for seven consecutive days at each time point. Isotemporal substitution analyses were conducted to examine the effect on self-regulation and executive functioning should an individual substitute sedentary time with light activity, MVPA, or sleep. The substitution of sedentary time with both sleep and MVPA influenced both self-regulatory strategy use and executive functioning. Sleep was associated with greater self-monitoring (B¬†=¬†.23, p¬†=¬†.02), goal-setting (B¬†=¬†.32, p¬†{\textless}¬†.01), and social support (B¬†=¬†.18, p¬†=¬†.01) behaviors. Substitution of sedentary time with MVPA was associated with higher accuracy on 2-item (B¬†=¬†.03, p¬†=¬†.01) and 3-item (B¬†=¬†.02, p¬†=¬†.04) spatial working memory tasks, and with faster reaction times on single (B¬†=¬†‚àí23.12, p¬†=¬†.03) and mixed-repeated task-switching blocks (B¬†=¬†‚àí27.06, p¬†=¬†.04). Substitution of sedentary time with sleep was associated with marginally faster reaction time on mixed-repeated task-switching blocks (B¬†=¬†‚àí12.20, p¬†=¬†.07) and faster reaction time on mixed-switch blocks (B¬†=¬†17.21, p¬†=¬†.05), as well as reduced global reaction time switch cost (B¬†=¬†‚àí16.86, p¬†=¬†.01). Substitution for light intensity physical activity did not produce significant effects. By replacing sedentary time with sleep and MVPA, individuals may bolster several important domains of self-regulatory behavior and executive functioning. This has important implications for the design of long-lasting health behavior interventions.},

	abstract = {Purpose:
To present age- and sex- specific percentiles for daily wrist-worn movement metrics in U.S. youth and adults. This metric represents a summary of all recorded movement, regardless of the purpose, context, or intensity.

Methods:
Wrist-worn accelerometer data from the combined 2011‚Äì2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles and the 2012 NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey (NNYFS) were used for this analysis. Monitor-Independent Movement Summary units (MIMS-units) from raw triaxial accelerometer data were used. We removed the partial first and last assessment days and days with ‚â• 5\% non-wear time. Participants with ‚â• 1 valid day were included. Mean MIMS-units were calculated across all valid days. Percentile tables and smoothed curves of daily MIMS-units were calculated for each age and sex using Generalized Additive Models for Location Shape and Scale (GAMLSS).

Results:
The analytical sample included 14,705 participants ages ‚â• 3 years. The MIMS-unit activity among youth was similar for both sexes while adult females generally had higher MIMS-unit activity than males. Median daily MIMS-units peaked at age 6 for both sexes (males: 20,613; females: 20,706). Lowest activity was observed for males and females 80+ years of age; 8,799 and 9,503, respectively.

Conclusion:
Population referenced MIMS-unit percentiles for U.S. youth and adults are a novel means of characterizing total activity volume. By using MIMS-units, we provide a standardized reference that can be applied across various wrist-worn accelerometer devices. Further work is needed to link these metrics to activity intensity categories and health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: Given the evolution of processing and analysis methods for accelerometry data over the past decade, it is important to understand how newer summary measures of physical activity compare with established measures.
Objective: We aimed to compare objective measures of physical activity to increase the generalizability and translation of findings of studies that use accelerometry-based data.
Methods: High-resolution accelerometry data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging were retrospectively analyzed. Data from 655 participants who used a wrist-worn ActiGraph GT9X device continuously for a week were summarized at the minute level as ActiGraph activity count, monitor-independent movement summary, Euclidean norm minus one, mean amplitude deviation, and activity intensity. We calculated these measures using open-source packages in R. Pearson correlations between activity count and each measure were quantified both marginally and conditionally on age, sex, and BMI. Each measures pair was harmonized using nonparametric regression of minute-level data.
Results: Data were from a sample (N=655; male: n=298, 45.5\%; female: n=357, 54.5\%) with a mean age of 69.8 years (SD 14.2) and mean BMI of 27.3 kg/m2 (SD 5.0). The mean marginal participant-specific correlations between activity count and monitor-independent movement summary, Euclidean norm minus one, mean amplitude deviation, and activity were r=0.988 (SE 0.0002324), r=0.867 (SE 0.001841), r=0.913 (SE 0.00132), and r=0.970 (SE 0.0006868), respectively. After harmonization, mean absolute percentage errors of predicting total activity count from monitor-independent movement summary, Euclidean norm minus one, mean amplitude deviation, and activity intensity were 2.5, 14.3, 11.3, and 6.3, respectively. The accuracies for predicting sedentary minutes for an activity count cut-off of 1853 using monitor-independent movement summary, Euclidean norm minus one, mean amplitude deviation, and activity intensity were 0.981, 0.928, 0.904, and 0.960, respectively. An R software package called SummarizedActigraphy, with a unified interface for computation of the measures from raw accelerometry data, was developed and published.
Conclusions: The findings from this comparison of accelerometry-based measures of physical activity can be used by researchers and facilitate the extension of knowledge from existing literature by demonstrating the high correlation between activity count and monitor-independent movement summary (and other measures) and by providing harmonization mapping.

This study examined the associations of MVPA and SB with all-cause mortality in HF patients using a nationally representative survey data. Methods National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (2007‚Äì2014) were used. 711 adults with self-reported congestive HF, linked to 2015 mortality data were analyzed. Self-reported MVPA and SB minutes were used to create the three MVPA [No-MVPA, insufficient (I-MVPA; {\textless}150 min/wk), and sufficient (S-MVPA; ‚â•150 min/wk)] and two SB ({\textless}8 and ‚â•8 hrs/d) groups. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to test the associations of MVPA and SB with all-cause mortality. Results 119 deaths occurred over an average of 4.9 years of follow-up. Lower MVPA and higher SB were independently associated with poor survival (P {\textless} .001). Joint and stratified analyses showed that the protective effect of MVPA was most pronounced among patients with SB{\textless}8 hrs/d. There was no difference in the mortality risk by SB levels within I-MVPA and S-MVPA groups; however, in the No-MVPA group, those with SB‚â•8 hrs/d had a greater risk of mortality compared to those with {\textless}8 hrs/d (Hazard ratio = 1.60). Conclusion In this HF cohort, MVPA and SB were independently and jointly associated with all-cause mortality. The beneficial effect of MVPA is attenuated by excessive SB; however, engaging in some amount of MVPA may provide a protective effect and attenuates the detrimental effects associated with excessive SB.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical activity is associated with depression. However, benefits of physical activity on depression may differ for specific domains of physical activity (i.e., leisure-time, work, and travel). Moreover, the relationship between physical activity and depression could also differ for people in different Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. This study investigated the relationship between domain-specific physical activity and BMI with depression, and the moderation effects of BMI on the relationship between domain physical activity and depression.
METHODS: Complex survey data from the NHANES 2011-2014 was used (N=10,047). Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Participants reported physical activity minutes in each domain using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Demographic characteristics were self-reported. Weight and height were objectively measured and used for calculating BMI. Survey procedures were used to account for complex survey design. As two survey cycles were used, sampling weights were re-calculated and used for analyses. Taylor series linearisation was chosen as a variance estimation method.
RESULTS: Participants who engaged in ‚â•150 minutes/week of total moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (adjusted B = 0.83, 95\% CI [0.50, 1.16]) and leisure-time MVPA (adjusted B = 0.84, 95\% CI [0.57, 1.11]) experienced lower levels of depression compared to those engaging in {\textless}150 MVPA minutes/week. Work and travel-related physical activity were not associated with depression. Overweight (adjusted B = -0.40, 95\% CI [-0.76, -0.04]) and underweight/normal weight participants (adjusted B = -0.60, 95\%CI [-0.96, -0.25]) experienced less depressive symptoms compared to obese participants. BMI did not moderate the relationship between domain-specific physical activity and depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that focus on leisure-time physical activity appear to be best suited to improve depression, however, this needs to be confirmed in purposefully designed intervention studies. Future studies may also examine ways to improve the effectiveness of work and travel physical activity for reducing depression.},

Lifestyle behaviors such as moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time (ST) may mitigate this decline, though limited research on the joint association exists. The aim of the study was to examine the joint association of MVPA and ST on cognitive function by hypertension status. Methods Adults (n=2916, ‚â•60yrs) from the 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were assessed for their participation in MVPA (meets recommendations: ‚â•150min MPA and/or ‚â•75min MPA vs does not meet recommendations: {\textless}150min MPA and {\textless}75min VPA), self-reported ST (‚â§7hrs ST vs {\textgreater}7hrs ST), hypertension, and cognitive function (Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST]; Animal Fluency [AF] test). Weighted linear regression analyses were conducted to assess joint association of MVPA and ST on cognitive function, and test the modifying effect of hypertension status (alpha level set at 0.1) after adjustment for demographics, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and depression. Results See Table. There were significant main effects for combined MVPA and ST on DSST (Wald F(3,30)=3.393, p=.031) and AF (Wald F(3,30)=17.33, p{\textless}.001). Participants who did not meet MVPA recommendations regardless of ST had significantly worse scores on DSST compared to participants who met MVPA recommendations and reported ‚â§7hr ST. Participants who did not meet MVPA recommendations and had ‚â§7hr ST had significantly worse scores on AF. There was a significant interaction between MVPA-ST groups and hypertension status on AF (Wald F(3,30)=3.766, p=.021), but not on DSST. Stratified analyses indicated among individuals without hypertension significance was maintained. For participants with hypertension, not meeting MVPA recommendations regardless of ST was associated with significantly worse scores. Conclusions In a sample of adults, meeting recommendations for MVPA was associated with better cognitive outcomes regardless of ST. Among individuals with hypertension regular MVPA regardless of ST was significantly associated with higher scores on one measure of executive function. This research highlights the added importance for individuals with hypertension to participate in the recommended amount of MVPA.},

	abstract = {The updated 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (PAG) reaffirmed key recommendations regarding aerobic activity in the 2008 edition and recently introduced health risks of sedentary behaviors and their association with physical activity.To examine the concurrent changing trends in adherence to the PAG for aerobic activity and time spent on sedentary behavior in US adults from 2007 to 2016.This study used data from a series of cross-sectional, nationally representative surveys on adults 18 years or older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 2007 to 2016. Data analysis was performed from September 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019.Duration, frequency, and intensity of leisure-time, work-related, and transportation-related aerobic activity were ascertained by a standardized questionnaire and summed as minutes per week. Adherence to the PAG for aerobic activity was defined as engaging in at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity. Time spent on sedentary behavior was estimated by hours spent sitting on a typical day.Among 27‚ÄØ343 participants 18 years or older (13 630 [52.0\%] female; 14‚ÄØ628 [66.6\%] non-Hispanic white), the weighted adherence rate to the PAG for aerobic activity was 65.2\% (95\% CI, 62.3\%-68.2\%) in 2015-2016, with no significant change from 2007-2008 (63.2\%; 95\% CI, 60.2\%-66.1\%) to 2015-2016 (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.15 for trend). Time spent on sedentary behavior significantly increased over time from a weighted mean (SE) of 5.7 (0.3) hours per day in 2007-2008 to 6.4 (0.2) hours per day in 2015-2016 (P‚Äâ\&lt;‚Äâ.001 for trend). The weighted proportion of people not adhering to the PAG for aerobic activity and reporting long sedentary time (\&gt;6 hours per day) increased from 16.1\% (95\% CI, 14.4\%-17.8\%) in 2007-2008 to 18.8\% (95\% CI, 17.7\%-20.0\%) in 2015-2016.The findings suggest that the adherence rate to the PAG for aerobic activity in US adults has not improved since the release of the first edition in 2008 but that time spent on sedentary behavior has significantly increased over time. Further nationwide efforts appear to be warranted to not only promote physical activity but also reduce sedentary time in the United States.},

We used machine learning methods to determine factors associated with the decision to extubate the critically ill patient at the end of life, and whether the terminal extubation shortens the dying process. We performed a secondary data analysis of a large, prospective, multicentre, cohort study, death prediction and physiology after removal of therapy (DePPaRT), which collected baseline data as well as ECG, pulse oximeter and arterial waveforms from WLST until 30¬†min after death. We analysed a priori defined factors associated with the decision to perform terminal extubation in WLST using the random forest method and logistic regression. Cox regression was used to analyse the effect of terminal extubation on time from WLST to death. A total of 616 patients were included into the analysis, out of which 396 (64.3\%) were terminally extubated. The study centre, low or no vasopressor support, and good respiratory function were factors significantly associated with the decision to extubate. Unadjusted time to death did not differ between patients with and without extubation (median survival time extubated vs. not extubated: 60 [95\% CI: 46; 76] vs. 58 [95\% CI: 45; 75] min). In contrast, after adjustment for confounders, time to death of extubated patients was significantly shorter (49 [95\% CI: 40; 62] vs. 85 [95\% CI: 61; 115] min). The decision to terminally extubate is associated with specific centres and less respiratory and/or vasopressor support. In this context, terminal extubation was associated with a shorter time to death.},

The improved classification of PBC might be important to identify subgroups of the disease, relevant to patient management. Machine learning algorithms may allow a better understanding of the relationships within heterogeneous clinical syndromes. This work aims to show the potential of unsupervised learning techniques for improving classification in PBC. A dataset of 712 women with PBC is used as a motivating example. A set of variables containing biological prognostic parameters is considered to define groups of individuals. Four different clustering methods are used: K-means, self-organising maps, hierarchical agglomerative (HAC), and Gaussian mixture models clustering. HAC outperforms the other clustering methods. With an optimal partitioning parameter, the methods identify two clusters with different clinical profiles. Patients in the first cluster are younger and have lower values of the oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) than patients in the second cluster. Moreover, cathepsin D values are lower in the first cluster. The three most important variables identified by the HAC are: age, ER, and PgR. Unsupervised learning seems a suitable alternative for the analysis of PBC data, opening up new perspectives in the particularly active domain of dissecting clinical heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Purpose¬†
        The study aims were to compare raw triaxial accelerometer output from ActiGraph GT3X+ (AG) and GENEActiv (GA) placed on the hip and the wrist and to develop regression equations for estimating energy expenditure.
        Methods¬†
        Thirty children (7‚Äì11 yr) and 30 adults (18‚Äì65 yr) completed eight activities (ranging from lying to running) while wearing one AG and one GA on the hip and the wrist. Oxygen consumption (VÀôO2) was measured with indirect calorimetry. Analysis involved the use of ANOVA to examine the effect of activity, brand, and placement on the acceleration values, intraclass correlation coefficient to evaluate the agreement between the two brands and placements, and linear regression to establish intensity thresholds.
        Results¬†
        A significant difference in acceleration values between the hip and the wrist placement was found (P {\textless} 0.001). The output from the wrist placement was, in general, higher compared with that from the hip. There was no main effect of monitor brand in adults (P {\textless} 0.12) and children (P {\textless} 0.73), and the intraclass correlation coefficient showed a strong agreement (0.96‚Äì0.99). However, a three-way interaction and systematic error between the brands was found in children. Acceleration from both brands and placements showed a strong correlation with VÀôO2. The intensity classification accuracy of the developed thresholds for both brands and placements was, in general, higher for adults compared with that for children and was greater for sedentary/light (93\%‚Äì97\%), and vigorous activities (68\%‚Äì92\%) than that for moderate activities (33\%‚Äì59\%).
        Conclusions¬†
        Accelerometer outputs from AG and GA seem comparable when attached to the same body location in adults, whereas inconsistent differences are apparent between the two brands and placements in children, hence limiting the comparability between brands in this age group.},

	abstract = {To convert accelerometer-based devices onto the same scale, a platform called Monitor-Independent Movement Summary (MIMS) was created and used in national studies. Yet, its physical activity (PA) intensity cutoff scores have not been established, making it less useful. This study was to link MIMS with the ActiGraph Count, known as ‚Äúthe Count,‚Äù using the test-equating method. A total of 81 obese participants aged 10‚Äì17 years old (male = 56\%) were recruited to perform one-minute warm-ups and walking or running at different speeds with ActiGraph on hips. Data with corresponding Count and MIMS were split into training (n = 65, male = 54\%) and testing samples (n = 16, male = 63\%). Linear and equipercentile equating were applied to the training sample to equate MIMS onto Count, creating MIMS-equated Count (MIMS-EQ-Count), a new MIMS-based unit. High correlation (‚â•.84), high agreements ({\textgreater}.7) and kappas (mostly {\textgreater}.5) between MIMS-EQ-Count and the Count in both training and testing samples under both linear and equipercentile methods. Equipercentile was the best equating method because of smaller standard errors. Yielded from equipercentile equating, a table linking MIMS and MIMS-EQ-Count was constructed, from which MIMS was linked and cross-validated with the well-studied Count. MIMS can now use the rich information accumulated for the Count of ActiGraph.},

	abstract = {Background: Given the evolution of processing and analysis methods for accelerometry data over the past decade, it is important to understand how newer summary measures of physical activity compare with established measures.
Objective: We aimed to compare objective measures of physical activity to increase the generalizability and translation of findings of studies that use accelerometry-based data.
Methods: High-resolution accelerometry data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging were retrospectively analyzed. Data from 655 participants who used a wrist-worn ActiGraph GT9X device continuously for a week were summarized at the minute level as ActiGraph activity count, monitor-independent movement summary, Euclidean norm minus one, mean amplitude deviation, and activity intensity. We calculated these measures using open-source packages in R. Pearson correlations between activity count and each measure were quantified both marginally and conditionally on age, sex, and BMI. Each measures pair was harmonized using nonparametric regression of minute-level data.
Results: Data were from a sample (N=655; male: n=298, 45.5\%; female: n=357, 54.5\%) with a mean age of 69.8 years (SD 14.2) and mean BMI of 27.3 kg/m2 (SD 5.0). The mean marginal participant-specific correlations between activity count and monitor-independent movement summary, Euclidean norm minus one, mean amplitude deviation, and activity were r=0.988 (SE 0.0002324), r=0.867 (SE 0.001841), r=0.913 (SE 0.00132), and r=0.970 (SE 0.0006868), respectively. After harmonization, mean absolute percentage errors of predicting total activity count from monitor-independent movement summary, Euclidean norm minus one, mean amplitude deviation, and activity intensity were 2.5, 14.3, 11.3, and 6.3, respectively. The accuracies for predicting sedentary minutes for an activity count cut-off of 1853 using monitor-independent movement summary, Euclidean norm minus one, mean amplitude deviation, and activity intensity were 0.981, 0.928, 0.904, and 0.960, respectively. An R software package called SummarizedActigraphy, with a unified interface for computation of the measures from raw accelerometry data, was developed and published.
Conclusions: The findings from this comparison of accelerometry-based measures of physical activity can be used by researchers and facilitate the extension of knowledge from existing literature by demonstrating the high correlation between activity count and monitor-independent movement summary (and other measures) and by providing harmonization mapping.

All laboratory data (n = 36) and 11 participants‚Äô free-living data were used to develop vector magnitude count cut-points (counts/min) for activity intensity for the wrist-worn accelerometer, and 12 participants‚Äô free-living data were used to cross-validate cut-point accuracy.

These cut-points had an accuracy of 70.8\% for assessing free-living activity intensity, whereas Sasaki/Freedson cut-points for the hip accelerometer had an accuracy of 77.1\%, and Hildebrand Euclidean Norm Minus One (ENMO) cut-points for the wrist accelerometer had an accuracy of 75.2\%. While accuracy was higher for a hip-worn accelerometer and for ENMO wrist cut-points, the high wear compliance of wrist accelerometers shown in past work and the ease of use of count-based analysis methods may justify use of these developed cut-points until more accurate, equally usable methods can be developed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the association of sleep, sedentary activity and physical activity with cognitive function among older adults, with consideration of the competing nature between variables of activity status.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: A total of 3086 older adults (60 years or older) in the 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were included. The Global Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to measure self-reported time for sedentary activity, walking/bicycling and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Cognitive function was examined using the CERAD Word Learning subtest (memory), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (executive function/processing speed), and Animal Fluency Test (language). Sleep duration was obtained via interview. Isotemporal substitution models using multivariable linear regression were applied to examine the associations of replacing sleep, sedentary activity, walking/bicycling, MVPA with each other and cognitive function, stratified by sleep duration per night (‚â§7h, {\textgreater}7h).
RESULTS: Among participants with sleep duration ‚â§7h/night, replacing 30min/day of sedentary activity with 30min/day of MVPA or 30min/day was associated with better cognition. Among participants with sleep duration {\textgreater}7h/night, replacing 30min/day of sleep with 30min/day of sedentary activity, walking/bicycling, or MVPA was associated with better cognition.
CONCLUSIONS: Replacing sedentary activities with MVPA was associated with favorable cognitive function among older adults sleeping no longer than 7h/night, and replacing excessive sleep with sedentary or physical activities was associated with favorable cognition. Future research is expected to examine the associations of replacing different activity status on long-term cognitive outcomes in longitudinal studies.},

	abstract = {This study investigates differences in physical activity between weekdays and weekend days, and its associations with sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics in the U.S population using the NHANES 2011‚Äì2014 data. Physical activity was measured using ActiGraph GT3X+. Raw acceleration data were converted to Monitor-Independent Movement Summary units (MIMS-units) that account for inter-device variability and eliminates non-human movement. The daily MIMS-units were averaged for weekdays and weekend days. Demographic characteristics were self-reported. Height and weight were objectively measured. The sample included 6611 adults aged¬†‚â•¬†20¬†years and 3520 children aged between 6 and 19¬†years. The results show that more MIMS-units were registered on weekdays compared to weekend days for adults (652, 95\%CI¬†=¬†533, 770) and children (889, 95\%CI¬†=¬†702, 1076). Factors associated with physical activity in adults (gender, age, marital status, ethnicity, education level, and weight status) were similar for weekdays and weekend days. In children, physical activity was associated with ethnicity, weight status, and age. The level of differences in physical activity between weekdays and weekend days among adults was larger for men, Hispanic Americans, and those with lower education levels. Differences among children were similar across subgroups, except for those aged 16‚Äì19¬†years who had smaller level of difference compared to those aged 12‚Äì15¬†years. In conclusion, adults and children were more active on weekdays than weekend days. The effects of structured days (i.e., weekdays) on physical activity appeared to be similar across most child subgroups but more heterogeneous for adult subgroups. Interventions increasing physical activity opportunities during weekend days are warranted.},

The highest point estimate occurred in 2013/2014 (426 min/d), with a decreasing trend observed after this point (Plinear‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ.05). Similar trends were observed across physical activity levels and domains, with one exception: an overall linear increase was not observed among sufficiently active adults. The mean daily sitting time was lowest among highly active adults compared with less active adults when using the multidomain physical activity measure.

	abstract = {Background:
Accelerometers, often in conjunction with heart rate sensors, are extensively used to track physical activity (PA) in research. Research-grade instruments are often expensive and have limited battery capacity, limited storage, and high participant burden. Consumer-based activity trackers are equipped with similar technology and designed for long-term wear, and can therefore potentially be used in research.
Methods:
A total of 50 participants wore 2 ActiGraphs (wrist and hip), 2 Actihearts (upper and lower chest position), and 1 Polar M430 sport watch for 1 full day. We compared reported time (minutes) spent in sedentary behavior and in light, moderate, vigorous, and moderate to vigorous PA, step counts, activity energy expenditure, and total energy expenditure between devices. We used Pearson correlations, intraclass correlations, mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs), and Bland-Altman plots to assess criterion validity.
Results:
Pearson correlations between the Polar M430 and all research-grade instruments were moderate or stronger for vigorous PA (r range .59-.76), moderate to vigorous PA (r range .51-.75), steps (r range .85-.87), total energy expenditure (r range .88-.94), and activity energy expenditure (r range .74-.79). Bland-Altman plots showed higher agreement for higher intensities of PA. MAPE was high for most outcomes. Only total energy expenditure measured by the hip-worn ActiGraph and both Actiheart positions had acceptable or close to acceptable errors with MAPEs of 6.94\% (ActiGraph, 3 axes), 8.26\% (ActiGraph, 1 axis), 14.54\% (Actiheart, upper position), and 14.37\% (Actiheart, lower position). The wrist-worn ActiGraph had a MAPE of 15.94\% for measuring steps. All other outcomes had a MAPE of 22\% or higher. For most outcomes, the Polar M430 was most strongly correlated with the hip-worn triaxial ActiGraph, with a moderate or strong Pearson correlation for sedentary behavior (r=.52) and for light (r=.7), moderate (r=.57), vigorous (r=.76), and moderate to vigorous (r=.75) PA. In addition, correlations were strong or very strong for activity energy expenditure (r=.75), steps (r=.85), and total energy expenditure (r=.91).
Conclusions:
The Polar M430 can potentially be used as an addition to established research-grade instruments to collect some PA variables over a prolonged period. However, due to the high MAPE of most outcomes, only total energy expenditure can be trusted to provide close to valid results. Depending on the variable, the Polar M430 over- or underreported most metrics, and may therefore be better suited to report changes in PA over time for some outcomes, rather than as an accurate instrument for PA status in a population.},

Existing approaches for analyzing diurnal patterns using these data, including the cosinor model and functional principal component analysis, have revealed and quantified population-level diurnal patterns, but considerable subject-level variability remained uncaptured in features such as wake/sleep times and activity intensity. This remaining informative variability could provide a better understanding of chronotypes, or behavioral manifestations of one‚Äôs underlying 24-hour rhythm. Curve registration, or alignment, is a technique in functional data analysis that separates ‚Äúvertical‚Äù variability in activity intensity from ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù variability in time-dependent markers like wake and sleep times; this data-driven approach is well-suited to studying chronotypes using accelerometer data. We develop a parametric registration framework for 24-hour accelerometric rest-activity profiles represented as dichotomized into epoch-level states of activity or rest. Specifically, we estimate subject-specific piecewise linear time-warping functions parametrized with a small set of parameters. We apply this method to data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and illustrate how estimated parameters give a more flexible quantification of chronotypes compared to traditional approaches.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Abnormal physiology (e.g., inflammation), brought on by environmental exposures (e.g., diet or shiftwork [SW]), can affect numerous bodily systems, including the brain, and may be associated with depressive symptomatology. The study examined the associations between shiftwork and depressive symptoms and diet-related inflammation (estimated by the Dietary Inflammatory Index [DII]TM) and depressive symptoms. Additionally, diet was examined as a mediator between shiftwork and depressive symptoms.

Methods
Data were obtained from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005‚Äì2012). SW data were based on self-report. Dietary data were collected using 24-hour dietary recalls for DII calculation. Depressive symptoms were defined using a cut-point of 10 (moderate) on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI) for depressive symptoms by SW and DII quartiles.

Results
DII scores were associated with depressive symptoms among women. Women in DII quartile 4 were 30\% more likely to report depressive symptoms than women in quartile 1 (95\%CI=1.00‚Äì1.68). There was no association between symptoms and SW when using a PHQ-9 cut-point of 10. When using a cut-point of 5 (mild depressive symptoms), those working any form of shiftwork were more likely to suffer from mild symptoms than day workers (odds ratio=1.22; 95\%CI=1.04‚Äì1.43). There was some evidence for mediation by the DII between SW and depressive symptoms.

Conclusions
Future longitudinal studies should examine effects of reductions in inflammation through diet on depressive symptoms, especially among shiftworkers, to elucidate the role of diet on depression among these groups.},

	abstract = {Insufficient sleep can have serious and sometimes fatal consequences for fatigued workers and others around them. For example, an estimated 20\% of vehicle crashes are linked to drowsy driving. The National Sleep Foundation recommends that healthy adults sleep 7-9 hours per day. To assess the prevalence of short sleep duration among workers, CDC analyzed data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The analysis compared sleep duration by age group, race/ethnicity, sex, marital status, education, and employment characteristics. Overall, 30.0\% of civilian employed U.S. adults (approximately 40.6 million workers) reported an average sleep duration of ‚â§6 hours per day. The prevalence of short sleep duration (‚â§6 hours per day) varied by industry of employment (range: 24.1\%-41.6\%), with a significantly higher rate of short sleep duration among workers in manufacturing (34.1\%) compared with all workers combined. Among all workers, those who usually worked the night shift had a much higher prevalence of short sleep duration (44.0\%, representing approximately 2.2 million night shift workers) than those who worked the day shift (28.8\%, representing approximately 28.3 million day shift workers). An especially high prevalence of short sleep duration was reported by night shift workers in the transportation and warehousing (69.7\%) and health-care and social assistance (52.3\%) industries. Targeted interventions, such as evidence-based shift system designs that improve sleep opportunities and evidence-based training programs on sleep and working hours tailored for managers and employees, should be implemented to protect the health and safety of workers, their coworkers, and the public.},

	abstract = {Twenty-four-hour rhythms in immune parameters and functions are robustly observed phenomena in biomedicine. Here, we summarize the important role of sleep and associated parameters on the neuroendocrine regulation of rhythmic immune cell traffic to different compartments, with a focus on human leukocyte subsets. Blood counts of ‚Äústress leukocytes‚Äù such as neutrophils, natural killer cells, and highly differentiated cytotoxic T cells present a rhythm with a daytime peak. It is mediated by morning increases in epinephrine, leading to a mobilization of these cells out of the marginal pool into the circulation following a fast, beta2-adrenoceptor-dependent inhibition of adhesive integrin signaling. In contrast, other subsets such as eosinophils and less differentiated T cells are redirected out of the circulation during daytime. This is mediated by stimulation of the glucocorticoid receptor following morning increases in cortisol, which promotes CXCR4-driven leukocyte traffic, presumably to the bone marrow. Hence, these cells show highest numbers in blood at night when cortisol levels are lowest. Sleep adds to these rhythms by actively suppressing epinephrine and cortisol levels. In addition, sleep increases levels of immunosupportive mediators, such as aldosterone and growth hormone, which are assumed to promote T-cell homing to lymph nodes, thus facilitating the initiation of adaptive immune responses during sleep. Taken together, sleep‚Äìwake behavior with its unique neuroendocrine changes regulates human leukocyte traffic with overall immunosupportive effects during nocturnal sleep. In contrast, integrin de-activation and redistribution of certain leukocytes to the bone marrow during daytime activity presumably serves immune regulation and homeostasis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the physiological effects of extended (24 hours or more) work shifts in postgraduate medical training is limited. We aimed to quantify work hours, sleep, and attentional failures among first-year residents (postgraduate year 1) during a traditional rotation schedule that included extended work shifts and during an intervention schedule that limited scheduled work hours to 16 or fewer consecutive hours.
METHODS: Twenty interns were studied during two three-week rotations in intensive care units, each during both the traditional and the intervention schedule. Subjects completed daily sleep logs that were validated with regular weekly episodes (72 to 96 hours) of continuous polysomnography (r=0.94) and work logs that were validated by means of direct observation by study staff (r=0.98).
RESULTS: Seventeen of 20 interns worked more than 80 hours per week during the traditional schedule (mean, 84.9; range, 74.2 to 92.1). All interns worked less than 80 hours per week during the intervention schedule (mean, 65.4; range, 57.6 to 76.3). On average, interns worked 19.5 hours per week less (P{\textless}0.001), slept 5.8 hours per week more (P{\textless}0.001), slept more in the 24 hours preceding each working hour (P{\textless}0.001), and had less than half the rate of attentional failures while working during on-call nights (P=0.02) on the intervention schedule as compared with the traditional schedule.
CONCLUSIONS: Eliminating interns' extended work shifts in an intensive care unit significantly increased sleep and decreased attentional failures during night work hours.},

	abstract = {The updated 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (PAG) reaffirmed key recommendations regarding aerobic activity in the 2008 edition and recently introduced health risks of sedentary behaviors and their association with physical activity.To examine the concurrent changing trends in adherence to the PAG for aerobic activity and time spent on sedentary behavior in US adults from 2007 to 2016.This study used data from a series of cross-sectional, nationally representative surveys on adults 18 years or older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 2007 to 2016. Data analysis was performed from September 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019.Duration, frequency, and intensity of leisure-time, work-related, and transportation-related aerobic activity were ascertained by a standardized questionnaire and summed as minutes per week. Adherence to the PAG for aerobic activity was defined as engaging in at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity. Time spent on sedentary behavior was estimated by hours spent sitting on a typical day.Among 27‚ÄØ343 participants 18 years or older (13 630 [52.0\%] female; 14‚ÄØ628 [66.6\%] non-Hispanic white), the weighted adherence rate to the PAG for aerobic activity was 65.2\% (95\% CI, 62.3\%-68.2\%) in 2015-2016, with no significant change from 2007-2008 (63.2\%; 95\% CI, 60.2\%-66.1\%) to 2015-2016 (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.15 for trend). Time spent on sedentary behavior significantly increased over time from a weighted mean (SE) of 5.7 (0.3) hours per day in 2007-2008 to 6.4 (0.2) hours per day in 2015-2016 (P‚Äâ\&lt;‚Äâ.001 for trend). The weighted proportion of people not adhering to the PAG for aerobic activity and reporting long sedentary time (\&gt;6 hours per day) increased from 16.1\% (95\% CI, 14.4\%-17.8\%) in 2007-2008 to 18.8\% (95\% CI, 17.7\%-20.0\%) in 2015-2016.The findings suggest that the adherence rate to the PAG for aerobic activity in US adults has not improved since the release of the first edition in 2008 but that time spent on sedentary behavior has significantly increased over time. Further nationwide efforts appear to be warranted to not only promote physical activity but also reduce sedentary time in the United States.},

Lifestyle habits such as poor nutrition and smoking have been established to contribute to the development of periodontal disease, but limited research has investigated whether physical activity and sedentary lifestyle play a role. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and periodontal disease. Materials and Methods We used a nationally representative data set from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011‚Äì2012. We examined the association between physical activity and sedentary behaviour and periodontal disease using multivariable logistic regression models and reported odds ratios (ORs). Results Individuals with higher total physical activity, higher leisure time physical activity, and lower amount of total sedentary behaviour had lower periodontal disease prevalence. Adjusted multivariable regression models showed that higher sedentary behaviour (more than 7.5 h/day) was associated with higher odds of periodontal disease (OR = 1.17; 95\% confidence interval = 1.00‚Äì1.36; p = .045). Conclusions The findings showed that higher sedentary behaviour is associated with higher odds of periodontal disease. Future prospective longitudinal studies and strategies are needed to investigate implications further and define the magnitude of the association between physical activity and periodontal disease.},

This study examined the associations of MVPA and SB with all-cause mortality in HF patients using a nationally representative survey data. Methods National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (2007‚Äì2014) were used. 711 adults with self-reported congestive HF, linked to 2015 mortality data were analyzed. Self-reported MVPA and SB minutes were used to create the three MVPA [No-MVPA, insufficient (I-MVPA; {\textless}150 min/wk), and sufficient (S-MVPA; ‚â•150 min/wk)] and two SB ({\textless}8 and ‚â•8 hrs/d) groups. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to test the associations of MVPA and SB with all-cause mortality. Results 119 deaths occurred over an average of 4.9 years of follow-up. Lower MVPA and higher SB were independently associated with poor survival (P {\textless} .001). Joint and stratified analyses showed that the protective effect of MVPA was most pronounced among patients with SB{\textless}8 hrs/d. There was no difference in the mortality risk by SB levels within I-MVPA and S-MVPA groups; however, in the No-MVPA group, those with SB‚â•8 hrs/d had a greater risk of mortality compared to those with {\textless}8 hrs/d (Hazard ratio = 1.60). Conclusion In this HF cohort, MVPA and SB were independently and jointly associated with all-cause mortality. The beneficial effect of MVPA is attenuated by excessive SB; however, engaging in some amount of MVPA may provide a protective effect and attenuates the detrimental effects associated with excessive SB.},

	abstract = {Background: Wearable accelerometers have greatly improved measurement of physical activity, and the increasing popularity of smartwatches with inherent acceleration data collection suggest their potential use in the physical activity research domain; however, their use needs to be validated. Objective: This study aimed to assess the validity of accelerometer data collected from a Samsung Gear S smartwatch (SGS) compared with an ActiGraph GT3X+ (GT3X+) activity monitor. The study aims were to (1) assess SGS validity using a mechanical shaker; (2) assess SGS validity using a treadmill running test; and (3) compare individual activity recognition, location of major body movement detection, activity intensity detection, locomotion recognition, and metabolic equivalent scores (METs) estimation between the SGS and GT3X+. Methods: To validate and compare the SGS accelerometer data with GT3X+ data, we collected data simultaneously from both devices during highly controlled, mechanically simulated, and less-controlled natural wear conditions. First, SGS and GT3X+ data were simultaneously collected from a mechanical shaker and an individual ambulating on a treadmill. Pearson correlation was calculated for mechanical shaker and treadmill experiments. Finally, SGS and GT3X+ data were simultaneously collected during 15 common daily activities performed by 40 participants (n=12 males, mean age 55.15 [SD 17.8] years). A total of 15 frequency- and time-domain features were extracted from SGS and GT3X+ data. We used these features for training machine learning models on 6 tasks: (1) individual activity recognition, (2) activity intensity detection, (3) locomotion recognition, (4) sedentary activity detection, (5) major body movement location detection, and (6) METs estimation. The classification models included random forest, support vector machines, neural networks, and decision trees. The results were compared between devices. We evaluated the effect of different feature extraction window lengths on model accuracy as defined by the percentage of correct classifications. In addition to these classification tasks, we also used the extracted features for METs estimation. Results: The results were compared between devices. Accelerometer data from SGS were highly correlated with the accelerometer data from GT3X+ for all 3 axes, with a correlation ‚â•.89 for both the shaker test and treadmill test and ‚â•.70 for all daily activities, except for computer work. Our results for the classification of activity intensity levels, locomotion, sedentary, major body movement location, and individual activity recognition showed overall accuracies of 0.87, 1.00, 0.98, 0.85, and 0.64, respectively. The results were not significantly different between the SGS and GT3X+. Random forest model was the best model for METs estimation (root mean squared error of .71 and r-squared value of .50). Conclusions: Our results suggest that a commercial brand smartwatch can be used in lieu of validated research grade activity monitors for individual activity recognition, major body movement location detection, activity intensity detection, and locomotion detection tasks.},

We evaluated physical activity and sleep-related measures and discussed the potential application of such devices for large-scale step and sleep data acquisition. To that end, we conducted two separate studies. In Study 1, we evaluated the performance of MB by comparing it to the GT3X (ActiGraph, wGT3X-BT), a scientific actigraph used in research, as well as subjective sleep reports. In Study 2, we distributed the MB across four countries (Austria, Germany, Cuba, and Ukraine) and investigated physical activity and sleep among these countries. The results of Study 1 indicated that MB step counts correlated highly with the scientific GT3X device, but did display biases. In addition, the MB-derived wake-up and total-sleep-times showed high agreement with subjective reports, but partly deviated from GT3X predictions. Study 2 revealed similar MB step counts across countries, but significant later wake-up and bedtimes for Ukraine than the other countries. We hope that our studies will stimulate future large-scale sensor-based physical activity and sleep research studies, including various cultures.},

	abstract = {Background
Consumer-wearable activity trackers are small electronic devices that record fitness and health-related measures.

Objective
The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the validity and reliability of commercial wearables in measuring step count, heart rate, and energy expenditure.

Methods
We identified devices to be included in the review. Database searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and SPORTDiscus, and only articles published in the English language up to May 2019 were considered. Studies were excluded if they did not identify the device used and if they did not examine the validity or reliability of the device. Studies involving the general population and all special populations were included. We operationalized validity as criterion validity (as compared with other measures) and construct validity (degree to which the device is measuring what it claims). Reliability measures focused on intradevice and interdevice reliability.

Results
We included 158 publications examining nine different commercial wearable device brands. Fitbit was by far the most studied brand. In laboratory-based settings, Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Samsung appeared to measure steps accurately. Heart rate measurement was more variable, with Apple Watch and Garmin being the most accurate and Fitbit tending toward underestimation. For energy expenditure, no brand was accurate. We also examined validity between devices within a specific brand.

Conclusions
Commercial wearable devices are accurate for measuring steps and heart rate in laboratory-based settings, but this varies by the manufacturer and device type. Devices are constantly being upgraded and redesigned to new models, suggesting the need for more current reviews and research.},

	abstract = {Background
Early identification of childhood malnutrition is imperative to improve overall health outcomes, and more importantly, to start early intervention to decrease the risk of future complications. This study aimed to evaluate new malnutrition Z-score growth indicators for detecting pediatric malnutrition and degrees of severity and compare their accuracy with that of growth chart centiles.
Patients and Methods
This retrospective study included 475 pediatric patients from several pediatric nutrition clinics for six months. The participant's weight, height, age, and growth parameters were recorded using both traditional growth charts (centiles) and updated malnutrition indicators (z-scores). The percentage and degree of malnutrition using centiles and Z-scores were compared.
Results
In children aged {\textless}2 years, the percentage of malnutrition was 4.7\% higher when measured using new malnutrition indicators (weight-for-length Z-score) compared with (weight-for-length centiles). Our results also showed 9.6\% higher number of malnourished children {\textgreater}2 years of age when BMI-for-age Z-score was used compared to weight-for-height centiles while there were 15.8\% higher malnourished children when BMI-for-age Z-score was compared to BMI-for-age centiles for the same group. We found a significant difference (X2¬†=¬†202.548, P={\textless}.0001) between the degree of malnutrition in children aged {\textgreater}2 years using BMI-for-age Z-score (normal vs. malnourished) and the degree of malnutrition using BMI centiles (normal vs. malnourished). Approximately 34\% of the children classified as normal using centiles were classified as malnourished using Z-scores. Comparing the degrees of Malnutrition, approximately 23\% (45 of 196) of children classified as normal based on centiles were classified as having mild malnutrition when Z-scores were used, and 42\% (80 of 192) of children who were classified as having mild malnutrition based on centiles were classified as having moderate malnutrition when Z-scores were used.
Conclusions
In our study, a higher percentage of children showed malnutrition when assessed using the Z-score (BMI-for-age for children {\textgreater}2 years/weight-for-length for children {\textless}2 years of age) than the centiles growth chart.},

Multivariate logistic regression models were developed to explore the association between circadian syndrome and stroke. Simultaneously, subgroup analyses based on the difference of gender, race, and components associated with circadian syndrome also were performed.

There were approximately 3.48\% patients exclusively with stroke and 19.03\% patients exclusively with circadian syndrome in our study. The results suggested that the risk of stroke in patients with circadian syndrome was higher than that in patients without circadian syndrome (OR = 1.322, 95 CI\%: 1.020‚Äì1.713). Similar associations were found in women with circadian syndrome (OR = 1.515, 95 CI\%: 1.086‚Äì2.114), non-Hispanic whites with circadian syndrome (OR = 1.544, 95 CI\%: 1.124‚Äì2.122), participants with circadian syndrome who had elevated waist circumference (OR = 1.395, 95 CI\%: 1.070‚Äì1.819) or short sleep (OR = 1.763, 95 CI\%: 1.033‚Äì3.009).ConclusionCircadian syndrome was associated with the risk of stroke.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease remains incompletely understood. The relationship between circadian rhythm disturbances and histopathologic measures of cerebral small vessel disease has not been studied. We hypothesized that disrupted circadian rest-activity rhythms would be associated with a higher burden of cerebral small vessel disease pathology.
METHODS: We studied 561 community-dwelling older adults (mean age at death, 91.2, 27.4\% male) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We used actigraphy to quantify several measures of 24-hour rest-activity rhythmicity, including interdaily stability, intradaily variability, and amplitude, and used ordinal logistic regression models to relate these measures to the severity of cerebral arteriolosclerosis, atherosclerosis, macroinfarcts, and microinfarcts, assessed at autopsy.
RESULTS: Lower interdaily stability was associated with a higher burden of arteriolosclerosis, higher intradaily variability was associated with a higher burden of atherosclerosis and subcortical infarcts, and lower amplitude was associated with a higher burden of arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis and subcortical macroinfarcts. Moreover, the associations between interdaily stability and arteriolosclerosis and intradaily variability and subcortical infarcts were independent of cardiovascular risk factors, sleep fragmentation, and medical comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: Disrupted rest-activity rhythms are associated with a greater burden of cerebral small vessel disease in older adults.},

We analyzed 12,166 adults aged 30-79 years who participated in the 2007-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Sleep duration, self-reported trouble sleeping and sleep disorders were collected using a standardized questionnaire. We included three sleep factors (sleep duration, self-reported trouble sleeping and sleep disorder) to generate an overall sleep score, ranging from 0 to 3.

The definition of hypertension was based on self-reported antihypertensive medication use or biological measurement (systolic blood pressure ‚â•140‚Äâmm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ‚â•90 mm Hg). We used weighted logistic regression models to investigate the associations between sleep and hypertension. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 37.8\%.

	abstract = {The various non-standard schedules required of shift workers force abrupt changes in the timing of sleep and light-dark exposure. These changes result in disturbances of the endogenous circadian system and its misalignment with the environment. Simulated night-shift experiments and field-based studies with shift workers both indicate that the circadian system is resistant to adaptation from a day- to a night-oriented schedule, as determined by a lack of substantial phase shifts over multiple days in centrally controlled rhythms, such as those of melatonin and cortisol. There is evidence that disruption of the circadian system caused by night-shift work results not only in a misalignment between the circadian system and the external light-dark cycle, but also in a state of internal desynchronization between various levels of the circadian system. This is the case between rhythms controlled by the central circadian pacemaker and clock genes expression in tissues such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells, hair follicle cells, and oral mucosa cells. The disruptive effects of atypical work schedules extend beyond the expression profile of canonical circadian clock genes and affects other transcripts of the human genome. In general, after several days of living at night, most rhythmic transcripts in the human genome remain adjusted to a day-oriented schedule, with dampened group amplitudes. In contrast to circadian clock genes and rhythmic transcripts, metabolomics studies revealed that most metabolites shift by several hours when working nights, thus leading to their misalignment with the circadian system. Altogether, these circadian and sleep-wake disturbances emphasize the all-encompassing impact of night-shift work, and can contribute to the increased risk of various medical conditions. Here, we review the latest scientific evidence regarding the effects of atypical work schedules on the circadian system, sleep and alertness of shift-working populations, and discuss their potential clinical impacts.},

We aimed to investigate the association between sleep duration and different regional fat mass (FM) among a population of US adults. Methods: 9413 participants were included from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), from 2011 to 2018. The sleep duration was divided into short sleep ({\textless}7 h/day), normal sleep (7‚Äì9 h/day) and long sleep ({\textgreater}9 h/day). Different regional FM was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, including trunk FM, arms FM and legs FM. Fat mass index (FMI) was obtained by dividing FM (kg) by the square of body height (m2). Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between sleep duration and regional FMI. Results: The mean sleep duration was 7.1 ¬± 1.5 h/day. After adjusting for socio-demographic, lifestyle information, comorbid diseases and medications, short sleepers had higher trunk FMI (Œ≤ = 0.134, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.051‚Äì0.216, p = 0.001), arms FMI (Œ≤ = 0.038, 95\% CI: 0.016‚Äì0.06, p {\textless} 0.001) and legs FMI (Œ≤ = 0.101, 95\% CI: 0.044‚Äì0.158, p {\textless} 0.001) compared to normal sleepers, whereas no significant difference was found in long sleepers. The similar results were also observed in men, while short sleepers only had higher arms FM in women (all p {\textless} 0.01). In addition, compared to normal sleepers, short sleepers had higher arms FMI and legs FMI in the obese group (all p {\textless} 0.05), while no relationship was observed in non-obese group. Conclusions: Short sleep duration, but not long sleep duration, was independently related to the increased different regional body fat in US adults, especially in men and those with obesity.},

	abstract = {BackgroundSelf-employment is generally associated with better health outcomes and educational attainment can shape self-employment. Yet, Black Americans are less likely to be self-employed and analyses of self-employment and health among Black Americans are few. The aim of this study was to determine how educational attainment moderates the associations between self-employment and hypertension among Black adults.MethodsUsing data from the 2007‚Äì2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, participants who self-identified as non-Hispanic Black (n = 2,855) were categorized as (1) employees with no self-employment income, (2) employees with self-employment income, or (3) having full-time self-employment. Modified Poisson regressions and multiplicative interaction terms were used to determine whether educational attainment moderated the associations between self-employment and measured hypertension (i.e., 140/90 mm Hg or anti-hypertensive medication).ResultsMost participants were employees with no self-employment income (81.9\%), but 11.8\% were employees reporting some self-employment income and 6.3\% were self-employed full-time. About two in five (40.9\%) had hypertension. Having full-time self-employment was associated with lower risk of hypertension compared to those who were employees (risk ratio = 0.82, 95\% confidence interval = 0.67‚Äì0.98), and educational attainment moderated the associations among Black men such that part-time self-employment was associated with high rates of hypertension among Black men who had not completed high school.ConclusionsThese results suggest that full-time self-employment is associated with lower risk of hypertension among Black adults, but that being an employee with some self-employment income may elevate rates of hypertension among Black men depending on educational attainment. Future studies should assess pathways between self-employment and hypertension by educational attainment among Black women and men.},

Data sources Electronic databases (CINHAL, MEDLINE and Scopus) were searched to identify primary studies up to April 2021. Methods Papers reporting qualitative or quantitative studies exploring the subjective experience and/or preferences of nurses around shift patterns were considered, with no restrictions on methods, date or setting. Key study features were extracted including setting, design and results. Findings were organised thematically by key features of shift work. Results 30 relevant papers were published between 1993 and 2021. They contained mostly qualitative studies where nurses reflected on their experience and preferences around shift patterns. The studies reported on three major aspects of shift work: shift work per se (i.e. the mere fact of working shift), shift length, and time of shift. Across all three aspects of shift work, nurses strive to deliver high quality of care despite facing intense working conditions, experiencing physical and mental fatigue or exhaustion. Preference for or adaptation to a specific shift pattern is facilitated when nurses are consulted before its implementation or have a certain autonomy to self-roster. Days off work tend to mitigate the adverse effects of working (short, long, early or night) shifts. How shift work and patterns impact on experiences and preferences seems to also vary according to nurses‚Äô personal characteristics and circumstances (e.g. age, caring responsibilities, years of experience). Conclusions Shift patterns are often organised in ways that are detrimental to nurses‚Äô health and wellbeing, their job performance, and the patient care they provide. Further research should explore the extent to which nurses‚Äô preferences are considered when choosing or being imposed shift work patterns. Research should also strive to better describe and address the constraints nurses face when it comes to choice around shift patterns.},

	abstract = {Shift work is commonplace in modern societies, and shift workers are predisposed to the development of numerous chronic diseases. Disruptions to the circadian systems of shift workers are considered important contributors to the biological dysfunction these people frequently experience. Because of this, understanding how to alter shift work and zeitgeber (time cue) schedules to enhance circadian system function is likely to be key to improving the health of shift workers. While light exposure is the most important zeitgeber for the central clock in the circadian system, diet and exercise are plausible zeitgebers for circadian clocks in many tissues. We know little about how different zeitgebers interact and how to tailor zeitgeber schedules to the needs of individuals; however, in this review we share some guidelines to help shift workers adapt to their work schedules based on our current understanding of circadian biology. We focus in particular on the importance of diet timing and composition. Going forward, developments in phenotyping and ‚Äúenvirotyping‚Äù methods may be important to understanding how to optimise shift work. Non-invasive, multimodal, comprehensive phenotyping using multiple sources of time-stamped data may yield insights that are critical to the care of shift workers. Finally, the impact of these advances will be reduced without modifications to work environments to make it easier for shift workers to engage in behaviours conducive to their health. Integrating findings from behavioural science and ergonomics may help shift workers make healthier choices, thereby amplifying the beneficial effects of improved lifestyle prescriptions for these people.},

The accuracy of the Fitbit model Charge 3 has not yet been examined. Aims To compare the Fitbit Charge 3 against the research-grade accelerometer ActiGraph GT3X-BT in measuring average daily steps and minutes spent in different PA intensities. Methods Twenty-four young PWH wore a wrist-worn Fitbit Charge 3 and hip-worn ActiGraph GT3X-BT simultaneously for seven consecutive days in free-living conditions. Correlation of and differences between the devices for daily averages of PA parameters were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and paired t-test, respectively. Agreement between devices was assessed using Bland-Altman plots. Results Twenty participants (mean age 21.8) were included in the analyses. We found moderate to high correlations between Fitbit and ActiGraph measured daily averages for all PA variables, but statistically significant differences between devices for all variables except daily minutes of moderate PA. Fitbit overestimated average daily steps, minutes of light, vigorous and moderate-to-vigorous PA. Bland-Altman plots showed a measurement bias between devices for all parameters with increasing overestimation by the Fitbit for higher volumes of PA. Conclusion The Fitbit Charge 3 overestimated steps and minutes of light, moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA as compared to the ActiGraph GT3X-BT, and this bias increased with PA volume. The Fitbit should therefore be used with caution in research, and we advise users of the device to be cognizant of this overestimation.},

Monitor-based surveillance has potential, but the main challenge is the need for replicable outcomes from different monitors. This study investigated the agreement of movement behavior outcomes assessed with four research-grade activity monitors (i.e., Movisens Move4, ActiGraph GT3X+, GENEActiv, and Axivity AX3) in adults. Twenty-three participants wore four monitors on the non-dominant wrist simultaneously for seven days. Open-source software (GGIR) was used to estimate the daily time in sedentary, light, moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), and sleep (movement behaviors). The prevalence of participants meeting the PA and sleep recommendations were calculated from each monitor‚Äôs data. Outcomes were deemed equivalent between monitors if the absolute standardized difference and its 95\% confidence intervals (CI95\%) fell within‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.2 standard deviations (SD) of the mean of the differences. The participants were mostly men (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ14, 61\%) and aged 36 (SD‚Äâ=‚Äâ14) years. Pairwise confusion matrices showed that 83‚Äì87\% of the daily time was equally classified into the movement categories by the different pairs of monitors. The between-monitor difference in MVPA ranged from 1 (CI95\%: ‚àí¬†6, 7) to 8 (CI95\%: 1, 15) min/day. Most of the PA and sleep metrics could be considered equivalent. The prevalence of participants meeting the PA and the sleep guidelines was 100\% consistent across monitors (22 and 5 participants out of the 23, respectively). Our findings indicate that the various research-grade activity monitors investigated show high inter-instrument reliability with respect to sedentary, PA and sleep-related estimates when their raw data are processed in an identical manner. These findings may have important implications for advancement towards monitor-based PA and sleep surveillance systems.},

	abstract = {Background: Wearable activity monitors such as Fitbit enable users to track various attributes of their physical activity (PA) over time and have the potential to be used in research to promote and measure PA behavior. However, the measurement accuracy of Fitbit in absolute free-living conditions is largely unknown. Objective: To examine the measurement congruence between Fitbit Flex and ActiGraph GT3X for quantifying steps, metabolic equivalent tasks (METs), and proportion of time in sedentary activity and light-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity PA in healthy adults in free-living conditions. Methods: A convenience sample of 19 participants (4 men and 15 women), aged 18-37 years, concurrently wore the Fitbit Flex (wrist) and ActiGraph GT3X (waist) for 1- or 2-week observation periods (n=3 and n=16, respectively) that included self-reported bouts of daily exercise. Data were examined for daily activity, averaged over 14 days and for minutes of reported exercise. Average day-level data included steps, METs, and proportion of time in different intensity levels. Minute-level data included steps, METs, and mean intensity score (0 = sedentary, 3 = vigorous) for overall reported exercise bouts (N=120) and by exercise type (walking, n=16; run or sports, n=44; cardio machine, n=20). Results: Measures of steps were similar between devices for average day- and minute-level observations (all P values {\textgreater} .05). Fitbit significantly overestimated METs for average daily activity, for overall minutes of reported exercise bouts, and for walking and run or sports exercises (mean difference 0.70, 1.80, 3.16, and 2.00 METs, respectively; all P values  .05). Conclusions: Fitbit Flex provides accurate measures of steps for daily activity and minutes of reported exercise, regardless of exercise type. Although the proportion of time in different intensity levels varied between devices, examining the mean intensity score for minute-level bouts across different exercise types enabled interdevice comparisons that revealed similar measures of exercise intensity. Fitbit Flex is shown to have measurement limitations that may affect its potential utility and validity for measuring PA attributes in free-living conditions.},

	abstract = {Sleep quality has been directly linked to cognitive function, quality of life, and a variety of serious diseases across many clinical domains. Standard methods for assessing sleep involve overnight studies in hospital settings, which are uncomfortable, expensive, not representative of real sleep, and difficult to conduct on a large scale. Recently, numerous commercial digital devices have been developed that record physiological data, such as movement, heart rate, and respiratory rate, which can act as a proxy for sleep quality in lieu of standard electroencephalogram recording equipment. The sleep-related output metrics from these devices include sleep staging and total sleep duration and are derived via proprietary algorithms that utilize a variety of these physiological recordings. Each device company makes different claims of accuracy and measures different features of sleep quality, and it is still unknown how well these devices correlate with one another and perform in a research setting. In this pilot study of 21 participants, we investigated whether sleep metric outputs from self-reported sleep metrics (SRSMs) and four sensors, specifically Fitbit Surge (a smart watch), Withings Aura (a sensor pad that is placed under a mattress), Hexoskin (a smart shirt), and Oura Ring (a smart ring), were related to known cognitive and psychological metrics, including the n-back test and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We analyzed correlation between multiple device-related sleep metrics. Furthermore, we investigated relationships between these sleep metrics and cognitive scores across different timepoints and SRSM through univariate linear regressions. We found that correlations for sleep metrics between the devices across the sleep cycle were almost uniformly low, but still significant (p {\textless} 0.05). For cognitive scores, we found the Withings latency was statistically significant for afternoon and evening timepoints at p = 0.016 and p = 0.013. We did not find any significant associations between SRSMs and PSQI or cognitive scores. Additionally, Oura Ring‚Äôs total sleep duration and efficiency in relation to the PSQI measure was statistically significant at p = 0.004 and p = 0.033, respectively.

Data from Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs), including mHealth and wearables, can be transformed into digital biomarkers that act as indicators of health outcomes and can be used to diagnose and monitor a number of chronic diseases and conditions. There are many challenges faced by digital biomarker development, including a lack of regulatory oversight, limited funding opportunities, general mistrust of sharing personal data, and a shortage of open-source data and code. Further, the process of transforming data into digital biomarkers is computationally expensive, and standards and validation methods in digital biomarker research are lacking.Methods:In order to provide a collaborative, standardized space for digital biomarker research and validation, we present the first comprehensive, open-source software platform for end-to-end digital biomarker development: The Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline (DBDP).Results:Here, we detail the general DBDP framework as well as three robust modules within the DBDP that have been developed for specific digital biomarker discovery use cases.Conclusions:The clear need for such a platform will accelerate the DBDP‚Äôs adoption as the industry standard for digital biomarker development and will support its role as the epicenter of digital biomarker collaboration and exploration.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The study aims were to compare raw triaxial accelerometer output from ActiGraph GT3X+ (AG) and GENEActiv (GA) placed on the hip and the wrist and to develop regression equations for estimating energy expenditure.
METHODS: Thirty children (7-11 yr) and 30 adults (18-65 yr) completed eight activities (ranging from lying to running) while wearing one AG and one GA on the hip and the wrist. Oxygen consumption (VÀôO2) was measured with indirect calorimetry. Analysis involved the use of ANOVA to examine the effect of activity, brand, and placement on the acceleration values, intraclass correlation coefficient to evaluate the agreement between the two brands and placements, and linear regression to establish intensity thresholds.
RESULTS: A significant difference in acceleration values between the hip and the wrist placement was found (P {\textless} 0.001). The output from the wrist placement was, in general, higher compared with that from the hip. There was no main effect of monitor brand in adults (P {\textless} 0.12) and children (P {\textless} 0.73), and the intraclass correlation coefficient showed a strong agreement (0.96-0.99). However, a three-way interaction and systematic error between the brands was found in children. Acceleration from both brands and placements showed a strong correlation with VÀôO2. The intensity classification accuracy of the developed thresholds for both brands and placements was, in general, higher for adults compared with that for children and was greater for sedentary/light (93\%-97\%), and vigorous activities (68\%-92\%) than that for moderate activities (33\%-59\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Accelerometer outputs from AG and GA seem comparable when attached to the same body location in adults, whereas inconsistent differences are apparent between the two brands and placements in children, hence limiting the comparability between brands in this age group.},

	abstract = {Background: Health behavior change interventions that target childhood obesity in minority populations have led to inconsistent and short-lived results. The purpose of this study was to test a novel intervention that was personalized and family-based in a Latino population to reduce childhood obesity. Methods: Competency-Based Approaches to Community Health (COACH) was a randomized controlled trial. Latino parent-child pairs were recruited from community settings in Nashville, TN. Child eligibility criteria included age 3-5 years and a BMI ‚â•50th percentile. The intervention included 15 weekly, 90-minute sessions followed by 3 months of twice-monthly health coaching calls. The control group was a twice-monthly school readiness curriculum for 3 months. Sessions were conducted by a health coach in local community centers, with groups of 8-11 parent-child pairs. The primary outcome was child BMI trajectory across 12 months, measured at four times. The intervention's effect was assessed by using a longitudinal, linear mixed-effects growth model, adjusting for child gender, baseline child and parent age, and baseline parent BMI and education. Results: Of the 305 parent-child pairs assessed for eligibility, 117 were randomized (59 intervention, 58 control). Child BMI was available for 91.5\% at 1-year follow-up. Mean baseline child age was 4.2 [standard deviation (SD)‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.8] years, and 53.8\% of children were female. Mean baseline child BMI was 18.1 (SD‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.6) kg/m2. After adjusting for covariates, the intervention's effect on linear child BMI growth was -0.41‚Äâkg/m2 per year (95\% confidence interval -0.82 to 0.01; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.05). Conclusions: Over 1-year follow-up, the intervention resulted in slower linear BMI growth for Latino preschool-aged children from poverty.},

	abstract = {Background: Physical behavior researchers using motion sensors often use acceleration summaries to visualize, clean, and interpret data. Such output is dependent on device specifications (e.g., dynamic range, sampling rate) and/or are proprietary, which invalidate cross-study comparison of findings when using different devices. This limits flexibility in selecting devices to measure physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep. Purpose: Develop an open-source, universal acceleration summary metric that accounts for discrepancies in raw data among research and consumer devices. Methods: We used signal processing techniques to generate a Monitor-Independent Movement Summary unit (MIMS-unit) optimized to capture normal human motion. Methodological steps included raw signal harmonization to eliminate inter-device variability (e.g., dynamic g-range, sampling rate), bandpass filtering (0.2‚Äì5.0 Hz) to eliminate non-human movement, and signal aggregation to reduce data to simplify visualization and summarization. We examined the consistency of MIMS-units using orbital shaker testing on eight accelerometers with varying dynamic range (¬±2 to ¬±8 g) and sampling rates (20‚Äì100 Hz), and human data (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ60) from an ActiGraph GT9X. Results: During shaker testing, MIMS-units yielded lower between-device coefficient of variations than proprietary ActiGraph and ENMO acceleration summaries. Unlike the widely used ActiGraph activity counts, MIMS-units were sensitive in detecting subtle wrist movements during sedentary behaviors. Conclusions: Open-source MIMS-units may provide a means to summarize high-resolution raw data in a device-independent manner, thereby increasing standardization of data cleaning and analytical procedures to estimate selected attributes of physical behavior across studies.},

	abstract = {Introduction Machine learning (ML) accelerometer data processing methods have potential to improve the accuracy of device-based assessments of physical activity (PA) in young children. Yet the uptake of ML methods by health researchers has been minimal and the use of cut-points (CP) continues to be the norm, despite evidence of significant misclassification error. The lack of studies demonstrating a relative advantage for ML approaches over CP methods maybe a key contributing factor. Purpose The current study compared the accuracy of PA intensity predictions provided by ML classification models and previously published CPs for preschool-aged children. Methods In a free-living study, 31 preschool-aged children (mean age = 4.0 ¬± 0.9 y) wore wrist and hip ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers while completing a video recorded 20-minute free play session. Ground truth PA intensity was coded continuously using the Children‚Äôs Activity Rating Scale (CARS). Accelerometer data was classified as sedentary (SED), light intensity (LPA), or moderate-to-vigorous intensity (MVPA) using ML random forest PA classifiers and published CPs for preschool-aged children. Performance differences were evaluated in a hold-out sample by comparing weighted kappa statistics, classification accuracy for each intensity band, and equivalence testing. Results ML classification models (hip: Œ∫ = 0.76; wrist: Œ∫ = 0.72) exhibited significantly higher agreement with ground truth PA intensity than CP methods (hip: Œ∫ = 0.38‚Äì0.49; wrist: Œ∫ = 0.31‚Äì0.44). For the ML models, classification accuracy for SED and LPA ranged from 83\% - 88\%, while classification accuracy for MVPA ranged from 68\% - 78\%. For the CP‚Äôs, classification accuracy ranged from 50\% - 94\% for SED, 19\% - 75\% for LPA, and 44\% - 76.1\% for MVPA. ML classification models showed equivalence (within ¬± 0.5 SD) with directly observed time in SED, LPA, and MVPA. None of the CP‚Äôs exhibited evidence of equivalence. Conclusions Under free living conditions, ML classification models for hip or wrist accelerometer data provide more accurate assessments of PA intensity in young children than CP methods. The results demonstrate the relative advantage of ML methods over threshold-based approaches and adds to a growing evidence base supporting the feasibility and accuracy of ML accelerometer data processing methods.},

	abstract = {To convert accelerometer-based devices onto the same scale, a platform called Monitor-Independent Movement Summary (MIMS) was created and used in national studies. Yet, its physical activity (PA) intensity cutoff scores have not been established, making it less useful. This study was to link MIMS with the ActiGraph Count, known as ‚Äúthe Count,‚Äù using the test-equating method. A total of 81 obese participants aged 10‚Äì17 years old (male = 56\%) were recruited to perform one-minute warm-ups and walking or running at different speeds with ActiGraph on hips. Data with corresponding Count and MIMS were split into training (n = 65, male = 54\%) and testing samples (n = 16, male = 63\%). Linear and equipercentile equating were applied to the training sample to equate MIMS onto Count, creating MIMS-equated Count (MIMS-EQ-Count), a new MIMS-based unit. High correlation (‚â•.84), high agreements ({\textgreater}.7) and kappas (mostly {\textgreater}.5) between MIMS-EQ-Count and the Count in both training and testing samples under both linear and equipercentile methods. Equipercentile was the best equating method because of smaller standard errors. Yielded from equipercentile equating, a table linking MIMS and MIMS-EQ-Count was constructed, from which MIMS was linked and cross-validated with the well-studied Count. MIMS can now use the rich information accumulated for the Count of ActiGraph.},

	abstract = {This study investigates differences in physical activity between weekdays and weekend days, and its associations with sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics in the U.S population using the NHANES 2011‚Äì2014 data. Physical activity was measured using ActiGraph GT3X+. Raw acceleration data were converted to Monitor-Independent Movement Summary units (MIMS-units) that account for inter-device variability and eliminates non-human movement. The daily MIMS-units were averaged for weekdays and weekend days. Demographic characteristics were self-reported. Height and weight were objectively measured. The sample included 6611 adults aged¬†‚â•¬†20¬†years and 3520 children aged between 6 and 19¬†years. The results show that more MIMS-units were registered on weekdays compared to weekend days for adults (652, 95\%CI¬†=¬†533, 770) and children (889, 95\%CI¬†=¬†702, 1076). Factors associated with physical activity in adults (gender, age, marital status, ethnicity, education level, and weight status) were similar for weekdays and weekend days. In children, physical activity was associated with ethnicity, weight status, and age. The level of differences in physical activity between weekdays and weekend days among adults was larger for men, Hispanic Americans, and those with lower education levels. Differences among children were similar across subgroups, except for those aged 16‚Äì19¬†years who had smaller level of difference compared to those aged 12‚Äì15¬†years. In conclusion, adults and children were more active on weekdays than weekend days. The effects of structured days (i.e., weekdays) on physical activity appeared to be similar across most child subgroups but more heterogeneous for adult subgroups. Interventions increasing physical activity opportunities during weekend days are warranted.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate if the 24-hour activity profile (i.e. waking activities and sleep) objectively measured using wrist-worn accelerometry of patients scheduled for total hip arthroplasty (THA) improves postoperatively.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 51 THA patients with a mean age of 64 years (24 to 87) were recruited from a single public hospital. All patients underwent THA using the same surgical approach with the same prosthesis type. The 24-hour activity profiles were captured using wrist-worn accelerometers preoperatively and at 2, 6, 12, and 26 weeks postoperatively. Patient-reported outcomes (Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)) were collected at all timepoints except two weeks postoperatively. Accelerometry data were used to quantify the intensity (sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activities) and frequency (bouts) of activity during the day and sleep efficiency. The analysis investigated changes with time and differences between Charnley class.
RESULTS: Patients slept or were sedentary for a mean of 19.5 hours/day preoperatively and the 24-hour activity pattern did not improve significantly postoperatively. Outside of sleep, the patients spent their time in sedentary activities for a mean of 620 minutes/day (sd 143) preoperatively and 641 minutes/day (sd 133) six months postoperatively. No significant improvements were observed for light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities (p = 0.140, p = 0.531, and p = 0.407, respectively). Sleep efficiency was poor ({\textless} 85\%) at all timepoints. There was no postoperative improvement in sleep efficiency when adjusted for medications (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Patient-reported outcome measures showed a significant improvement with time in all domains when compared with preoperative levels. There were no differences with Charnley class at six months postoperatively. However, Charnley class C patients were more sedentary at two weeks postoperatively when compared with Charnley class A patients (p {\textless} 0.05). There were no further differences between Charnley classifications.
CONCLUSION: This study describes the 24-hour activity profile of THA patients for the first time. Prior to THA, patients in this cohort were inactive and slept poorly. This cohort shows no improvement in 24-hour activity profiles at six months postoperative. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2019;101-B:415-425.},

	abstract = {Wrist-worn wearable sensors have attracted considerable research interest because of their potential in providing continuous, longitudinal, non-invasive measurements, leading to insights into Physical Activity (PA), sleep, and circadian variability. Three key practical considerations for research-grade wearables are as follows: (a) choosing an appropriate sample rate, (b) summarizing raw three-dimensional accelerometry data for further processing (accelerometry summary measures), and (c) accurately estimating PA levels and sleep towards understanding participants' 24-hour profiles. We used the CAPTURE-24 dataset, where 148 participants concurrently wore a wrist-worn three-dimensional accelerometer and a wearable camera over approximately 24 h to obtain minute-by-minute labels: sleep; and sedentary light, moderate, and vigorous PA. We propose a new acceleration summary measure, the Rate of Change Acceleration Movement (ROCAM), and compare its performance against three established approaches summarizing three-dimensional acceleration data towards replicating the minute-by-minute labels. Moreover, we compare findings where the acceleration data was sampled at 10, 25, 50, and 100 Hz. We demonstrate the competitive advantage of ROCAM towards estimating the five labels (80.2\% accuracy) and building 24-hour profiles where the sample rate of 10 Hz is fully sufficient. Collectively, these findings provide insights facilitating the deployment of large-scale longitudinal actigraphy data processing towards 24-hour PA and sleep-profile assessment.},

	abstract = {The daily alternation between sleep and wakefulness is one of the most dominant features of our lives and is a manifestation of the intrinsic 24 h rhythmicity underlying almost every aspect of our physiology. Circadian rhythms are generated by networks of molecular oscillators in the brain and peripheral tissues that interact with environmental and behavioural cycles to promote the occurrence of sleep during the environmental night. This alignment is often disturbed, however, by contemporary changes to our living environments, work or social schedules, patterns of light exposure, and biological factors, with consequences not only for sleep timing but also for our physical and mental health. Characterised by undesirable or irregular timing of sleep and wakefulness, in this Series paper we critically examine the existing categories of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders and the role of the circadian system in their development. We emphasise how not all disruption to daily rhythms is driven solely by an underlying circadian disturbance, and take a broader, dimensional approach to explore how circadian rhythms and sleep homoeostasis interact with behavioural and environmental factors. Very few high-quality epidemiological and intervention studies exist, and wider recognition and treatment of sleep timing disorders are currently hindered by a scarcity of accessible and objective tools for quantifying sleep and circadian physiology and environmental variables. We therefore assess emerging wearable technology, transcriptomics, and mathematical modelling approaches that promise to accelerate the integration of our knowledge in sleep and circadian science into improved human health.},

Studies have found that these changes are governed by a biological clock, which in mammals is located in two brain areas called the suprachiasmatic nuclei. The circadian cycles established by this clock occur throughout nature and have a period of approximately 24 hours. In addition, these circadian cycles can be synchronized to external time signals but also can persist in the absence of such signals. Studies have found that the internal clock consists of an array of genes and the protein products they encode, which regulate various physiological processes throughout the body.

Relatively recent changes to our environments, such as the introduction of artificial lighting, can disorganize the circadian system, from the level of the molecular clocks that regulate the timing of cellular activities to the level of synchronization between our daily cycles of behavior and the solar day. Sleep/wake cycles are intertwined with the circadian system, and global trends indicate that these, too, are increasingly subject to disruption. A large proportion of the world's population is at increased risk of environmentally driven circadian rhythm and sleep disruption, and a minority of individuals are also genetically predisposed to circadian misalignment and sleep disorders. The consequences of disruption to the circadian system and sleep are profound and include myriad metabolic ramifications, some of which may be compounded by adverse effects on dietary choices. If not addressed, the deleterious effects of such disruption will continue to cause widespread health problems; therefore, implementation of the numerous behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions that can help restore circadian system alignment and enhance sleep will be important.},

Indeed, over a 24-h period, a person's preferred time to be more active or to sleep can be expressed in the concept of morningness-eveningness. Three chronotypes are distinguished: Morning, Neither, and Evening-types. Interindividual differences in chronotypes need to be considered to reduce the negative effects of circadian disruptions on health.

Circadian disruption leads to dysregulation of immune responses and inflammation which can further disrupt circadian rhythms. The response of organisms to immune challenges, such as allergic reactions also vary depending on time of the day, which can lead to detrimental responses particularly during the rest and early active periods. This review evaluates what is currently known in terms of circadian biology of immune response and the cross-talk between circadian and immune system. We discuss the circadian pattern of three respiratory-related inflammatory diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allergic rhinitis and asthma. Increasing our knowledge on circadian patterns of immune responses and developing chronotherapeutic studies in inflammatory diseases with strong circadian patterns will lead to preventive measures as well as improved therapies focussing on the circadian rhythms of symptoms and the daily variation of the patients‚Äô responses to medication.},

	doi = {10.1001/jama.2018.14854},
	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Approximately 80\% of US adults and adolescents are insufficiently active. Physical activity fosters normal growth and development and can make people feel, function, and sleep better and reduce risk of many chronic diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize key guidelines in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition (PAG).
PROCESS AND EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a systematic review of the science supporting physical activity and health. The committee addressed 38 questions and 104 subquestions and graded the evidence based on consistency and quality of the research. Evidence graded as strong or moderate was the basis of the key guidelines. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) based the PAG on the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The PAG provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity to improve a variety of health outcomes for multiple population groups. Preschool-aged children (3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development. Children and adolescents aged 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Adults should do at least 150 minutes to 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. They should also do muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. Older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Pregnant and postpartum women should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Adults with chronic conditions or disabilities, who are able, should follow the key guidelines for adults and do both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Recommendations emphasize that moving more and sitting less will benefit nearly everyone. Individuals performing the least physical activity benefit most by even modest increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Additional benefits occur with more physical activity. Both aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity are beneficial.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition, provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity that provide substantial health benefits. Health professionals and policy makers should facilitate awareness of the guidelines and promote the health benefits of physical activity and support efforts to implement programs, practices, and policies to facilitate increased physical activity and to improve the health of the US population.},

	abstract = {Dysfunction in 24-h circadian rhythms is a common occurrence in ageing adults; however, circadian rhythm disruptions are more severe in people with age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and Parkinson's disease. Manifestations of circadian rhythm disruptions differ according to the type and severity of neurodegenerative disease and, for some patients, occur before the onset of typical clinical symptoms of neurodegeneration. Evidence from preliminary studies suggest that circadian rhythm disruptions, in addition to being a symptom of neurodegeneration, might also be a potential risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and Parkinson's disease, although large, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this relationship. The mechanistic link between circadian rhythms and neurodegeneration is still not fully understood, although proposed underlying pathways include alterations of protein homoeostasis and immune and inflammatory function. While preliminary clinical studies are promising, more studies of circadian rhythm disruptions and its mechanisms are required. Furthermore, clinical trials are needed to determine whether circadian interventions could prevent or delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {The circadian system generates endogenous rhythms of approximately 24¬†h, the synchronisation of which are vital for healthy bodily function. The timing of many physiological processes, including glucose metabolism, are coordinated by the circadian system, and circadian disruptions that desynchronise or misalign these rhythms can result in adverse health outcomes. In this review, we cover the role of the circadian system and its disruption in glucose metabolism in healthy individuals and individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We begin by defining circadian rhythms and circadian disruption and then we provide an overview of circadian regulation of glucose metabolism. We next discuss the impact of circadian disruptions on glucose control and type 2 diabetes. Given the concurrent high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and circadian disruption, understanding the mechanisms underlying the impact of circadian disruption on glucose metabolism may aid in improving glycaemic control.},

As night workers experience a ‚Äòmisalignment‚Äô between their circadian system and daily sleep‚Äìwake behaviors, with negative health consequences, we investigated whether exposure to circadian misalignment underpins mood vulnerability in simulated shift work. We performed randomized within-subject crossover laboratory studies in non-shift workers and shift workers. Simulated night shifts were used to induce a misalignment between the endogenous circadian pacemaker and sleep/wake cycles (circadian misalignment), while environmental conditions and food intake were controlled. Circadian misalignment adversely impacted emotional state, such that mood and well-being levels¬†were significantly decreased throughout 4¬†days of continuous exposure to circadian misalignment in non-shift workers, as compared to when they were under circadian alignment (interaction of ‚Äúcircadian alignment condition‚Äù vs. ‚Äúday‚Äù, mood: p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001; well-being: p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001; adjusted p-values). Similarly, in shift workers, mood and well-being levels¬†were significantly reduced throughout days of misalignment, as compared to circadian alignment (interaction of ‚Äúcircadian alignment condition‚Äù vs. ‚Äúday‚Äù, mood: p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002; well-being: p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002; adjusted p-values). Our findings indicate that circadian misalignment is an important biological component for mood vulnerability, and that individuals who engage in shift work are susceptible to its deleterious mood effects.},

The aim of this study was to compare the phase-delaying effects of late night bright light, late night exercise, and late evening bright light followed by early morning exercise. In a within-subjects, counterbalanced design, 6 young adults completed each of three 2.5-day protocols. Participants followed a 3-h ultra-short sleep-wake cycle, involving wakefulness in dim light for 2h, followed by attempted sleep in darkness for 1 h, repeated throughout each protocol. On night 2 of each protocol, participants received either (1) bright light alone (5,000 lux) from 2210‚Äì2340 h, (2) treadmill exercise alone from 2210‚Äì2340 h, or (3) bright light (2210‚Äì2340 h) followed by exercise from 0410‚Äì0540 h. Urine was collected every 90 min. Shifts in the 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) cosine acrophase from baseline to post-treatment were compared between treatments. Analyses revealed a significant additive phase-delaying effect of bright light + exercise (80.8 ¬± 11.6 [SD] min) compared with exercise alone (47.3 ¬± 21.6 min), and a similar phase delay following bright light alone (56.6 ¬± 15.2 min) and exercise alone administered for the same duration and at the same time of night. Thus, the data suggest that late night bright light followed by early morning exercise can have an additive circadian phase-shifting effect.},

	abstract = {[Purpose] Previous studies have demonstrated a link between core body temperature and
interleukin-6 production. Recent studies have reported that 20 minutes of head-out
immersion in hot water (42¬∞C) increased serum interleukin-6 levels in young males. This
study aimed to compare the efficacy of head-out immersion in hot water (42¬∞C) on serum
interleukin-6 levels in seven elderly (66‚Äì75 years old) and eight young males (21‚Äì32 years
old). [Participants and Methods] Venous blood samples were drawn at rest, immediately
after head-out immersion in hot water (42¬∞C), after 1 hour, and after 2 hours. Levels of
serum interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-Œ±, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein;
blood cell counts; and core temperature were measured. [Results] It was found that 20
minutes of head-out immersion in hot water (42¬∞C) increased the core temperature in both
the elderly and young participants; however, the rise in core temperature was more
attenuated in elderly participants. Serum interleukin-6 levels were significantly higher
in young participants 1 hour after the head-out immersion in hot water (42¬∞C); however,
serum interleukin-6 levels did not change in elderly participants. Serum tumor necrosis
factor-Œ± and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels remained constant throughout the
study the elderly and young participants. [Conclusion] The current study demonstrated that
head-out immersion in hot water (42¬∞C) more attenuated core temperature and interleukin-6
levels in elderly participants than in young participants. We assert that these
differences are likely to be related to age-related changes in core temperature regulation

Such chronic, acquired diseases result when normal physiologic control goes awry and may thus be viewed as failures of homeostasis. However, while nearly every process in human physiology relies on homeostatic mechanisms for stability, only some have demonstrated vulnerability to dysregulation. Additionally, chronic inflammation is a common accomplice of the diseases of homeostasis, yet the basis for this connection is not fully understood. Here we review the design of homeostatic systems and discuss universal features of control circuits that operate at the cellular, tissue and organismal levels. We suggest a framework for classification of homeostatic signals that is based on different classes of homeostatic variables they report on. Finally, we discuss how adaptability of homeostatic systems with adjustable set points creates vulnerability to dysregulation and disease. This framework highlights the fundamental parallels between homeostatic and inflammatory control mechanisms and provides a new perspective on the physiological origin of inflammation.},

	abstract = {The excessive amount of reactive species under chronic inflammation, which are accompanied by an increase body temperature, lead to diabetic complications. Phagocyte NADPH oxidase is the key enzyme in these processes. The role of high temperature in its regulation in diabetes is not clear. The aim was to investigate the effect of high temperature on NADPH-oxidase-dependent generation of reactive species in diabetic patients. Chemiluminescent method was applied to assess respiratory burst kinetics initiated by opsonized zymosan in blood or phorbol ester in isolated granulocytes. Analyzing ROC curves, the main predictors and changes in stages of activation of NADPH oxidase were determined. Phosphoisoforms of p47phox and p67phox were quantified by immunoblotting. Response to opsonized zymosan was lower in all subjects at 40¬†¬∞C vs 37¬†¬∞C, its kinetic parameters (except Tmax) were higher in blood of patients vs controls. Response rate was the main significant predictor to distinguish groups of subjects at 40¬†¬∞C indicating NADPH oxidase upregulation in diabetes. Ca2+-dependent generation of reactive species by cells increased in both groups at 40¬†¬∞C vs 37¬†¬∞C, kinetic parameters were higher in patients. Initial phospho-p47phox level was higher in patient cells vs ones in controls. It was increased by ionomycin, phorbol ester, or 40¬†¬∞C in control cells and unchanged in patient ones. Phospho-p67phox level was unchangeable in intact cells of healthy donors and patients at both temperatures. Excessive amounts of reactive species in patient cells were the consequence of granulocyte priming due to p47phox phosphorylation. Thus, high temperature decreased phagocytosis- and enhanced Ca2+-dependent generation of reactive species making the differences between controls and patients less pronounced. The effect of temperature on the generation of reactive species in blood granulocytes is associated with activity of NADPH oxidase that can be a prospective therapeutic target for pathologies accompanied by inflammation including type 2 diabetes.},

Simple regression/correlation is often applied to non-independent observations or aggregated data; this may produce biased, specious results due to violation of independence and/or differing patterns between-participants versus within-participants. Unlike simple regression/correlation, rmcorr does not violate the assumption of independence of observations. Also, rmcorr tends to have much greater statistical power because neither averaging nor aggregation is necessary for an intra-individual research question. Rmcorr estimates the common regression slope, the association shared among individuals. To make rmcorr accessible, we provide background information for its assumptions and equations, visualization, power, and tradeoffs with rmcorr compared to multilevel modeling. We introduce the R package (rmcorr) and demonstrate its use for inferential statistics and visualization with two example datasets. The examples are used to illustrate research questions at different levels of analysis, intra-individual, and inter-individual. Rmcorr is well-suited for research questions regarding the common linear association in paired repeated measures data. All results are fully reproducible.},

Using cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES, 2007‚Äì2010), we found that shiftwork was associated with a lower amount of money spent on eating out and higher food insecurity issues. Compared to day workers, a higher proportion of shift workers reported receipt of food stamps (12.5\% vs. 23.4\%, p {\textless} 0.001) and worried about running out of food (3.95\% vs. 8.05\%, p {\textless} 0.001). These associations remained significant after adjustment for confounders when using multivariate logistic regression. The number of not-home-prepared meals did not differ between both groups. In light of the population health disparities and adverse health outcomes associated with food insecurity, novel strategies are urgently warranted to improve the situation of shift workers.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory disease that often goes undiagnosed, particularly in its early stages.

Objective:
To examine sociodemographic, general health, and COPD specific factors, including severity of lung obstruction, that are associated with healthcare provider-diagnosed COPD among U.S. adults.

Methods:
NHANES cross-sectional data collected from 2007‚Äì2012 on adults aged 40‚Äì79 years (n=10,219) were analyzed. The primary outcome was self-reported COPD diagnosis with predictive factors analyzed via chi-square and logistic regression analyses.

Results:
During 2007‚Äì2012, 5.2\% of US adults aged 40‚Äì79 reported being diagnosed with COPD. Among those diagnosed, 50.8\% reported fair or poor health, 47.1\% were currently smoking cigarettes, 49.1\% were taking prescription respiratory medication, 36.4\% had moderate or worse lung obstruction, and nearly 90\% had one or more respiratory symptoms. Logistic regression revealed positive associations between receiving a COPD diagnosis and the following: being white (AOR: 3.08, 95\% CI: 1.82‚Äì5.20); being aged 60‚Äì79 years (AOR: 1.65, 95\% CI: 1.07‚Äì2.53); reporting fair/poor health (AOR: 2.91, CI: 1.55‚Äì5.46); having 4‚Äì9 (AOR: 3.5, CI: 1.3‚Äì9.4) or 10 or more healthcare visits in prior year (AOR: 5.06, CI: 1.62‚Äì15.77); being a former (AOR: 1.75, CI: 1.2‚Äì2.5) or current smoker (AOR: 1.70, CI: 1.17‚Äì2.48); having more severe lung obstruction (AOR: 4.90, CI: 3.28‚Äì7.32); having 3 or more respiratory symptoms (AOR: 22.07, CI: 12.03‚Äì40.49).

Conclusions:
Multiple factors are associated with self-reported COPD diagnosis with number of reported respiratory symptoms having the strongest association. After controlling for other factors, having mild lung obstruction was not associated with being diagnosed.},

Trends were compared by chi-square tests. The age-adjusted prevalence (95\% confidence interval) for CKD was 14.1\% (13.1\%-15.0\%), 13.0\% (12.3\%-13.8\%), 14.0\% (13.0\%-15.1\%), and 13.3\% (12.3\%-14.4\%) in 2003-06, 2007-10, 2011-14, and 2015-18, respectively (p[trend]¬†=¬†0.24, N¬†=¬†39569).

The prevalence of hypertension remained static. The prevalence of current tobacco smoking and insufficient aerobic PA declined. The age-adjusted prevalence of CKD has plateaued; however, the prevalence of some risk factors is increasing.

Multiple linear regression models were fitted to examine the overall and sex-specific associations between serum Cu and the kidney function indicator-estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin‚Äìcreatinine ratio (UACR). Restricted cubic spline models (RCS) stratified by sex were performed to explore the sex-based dose‚Äìresponse associations. Serum Cu in the highest quartile was associated with higher levels of UACR (Œ≤ = 0.203, 95\% CI: 0.100 to 0.306) among overall participants. In males, there was an association of the highest Cu quartile with decreased eGFR (Œ≤ = ‚àí0.023, 95\% CI: ‚àí0.042 to ‚àí0.003) and increased UACR (Œ≤ = 0.349, 95\% CI: 0.171 to 0.527); serum Cu levels also demonstrated a negative nonlinear dose‚Äìresponse association with eGFR and a positive linear dose‚Äìresponse association with UACR in males, whereas females showed a marginally significant nonlinear positive association of eGFR with serum Cu levels. In conclusion, there were sex-specific and dose‚Äìresponse relationships between serum Cu and kidney function indicators. Further prospective and mechanistic studies are warranted.},

Results High cholesterol had the highest prevalence in all population (33.4 (95\% CI: 32.0 to 34.9)) and males. In females {\textless}65 years, the most prevalent disease was sleep disorder (32.1 (95\% CI: 29.6 to 34.5)) while in females ‚â•65 years, hypertension was the most prevalent disease (63.9 (95\% CI: 59.9 to 67.9)). Hypertension and high cholesterol were associated with the highest support (occur together most frequently) in all population regardless of genders. Hypertension displayed the highest betweenness centrality (mediating role in the network) followed by high cholesterol and arthritis in all population. For males aged {\textless}65 years, hypertension and high cholesterol presented the highest betweenness centrality. In males ‚â•65 years, hypertension, high cholesterol and arthritis were the top three diseases of degree centrality (direct association with other conditions). As for females ‚â•65 years, hypertension showed the highest betweenness centrality followed by high cholesterol and arthritis. The associations of hypertension, arthritis and one other item with high cholesterol presented the highest support in all population. In males, the associations of depression, hypertension with sleep disorders had the highest lift (the chance of co-occurrence of the conditions and significant association). Among females, the associations of depression, arthritis with sleep disorders had the highest lift.
Conclusion Hypertension and high cholesterol were prevalent in all population, regardless of females and males. Hypertension and high cholesterol, arthritis and hypertension, and diabetes and hypertension were more likely to coexist. The findings of this study might help make plans for the management and primary care of people with one or more diseases.},

	abstract = {Background
Physical function and physical activity decrease with age, but differences in physical activity patterns within different physical functioning groups are unknown.
Objectives
To describe physical activity patterns and multimorbidity burden by physical function group and age.
Methods
Actigraph accelerometer-derived physical activity patterns were compared by physical function (high functioning, activity limitations, activity of daily living disabled) determined by questionnaire and age among 2174 older adults (mean age‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ70.9, sd‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.2 years) from the cross-sectional 2003‚Äì2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Associations between physical function, physical activity, and multimorbidity were examined.
Results
Reduced physical function and increased age were associated with lower physical activity, increased sedentary time and a compressed activity profile. During the most active hour of the day (11:00 a.m.), the oldest, lowest physical functioning group was 82\% less active than the youngest, highest physical functioning group. High functioning had over 30\% more total activity counts, over 56\% more time in moderate-to-vigorous activity, about 8\% less time sedentary and took approximately one more sedentary break/hour than lower physical functioning groups. Gender differences in physical activity variables were prevalent for high functioning, but limited within reduced physical functioning groups. Physical function, age, total activity counts/day, and breaks in sedentary time/day were independently associated with multimorbidity (p‚ÄØ{\textless}‚ÄØ0.005).
Conclusions
Reduced physical function and increased age are associated with physical activity levels, and all three are associated with multimorbidity. Understanding physical activity differences by physical function is important for designing interventions for older individuals at increased risk for mobility disability.},

	abstract = {For the past 45 y, the National Center for Health Statistics at the CDC has carried out nutrition surveillance of the US population by collecting anthropometric, dietary intake, and nutritional biomarker data, the latter being the focus of this publication. The earliest biomarker testing assessed iron and vitamin A status. With time, a broad spectrum of water- and fat-soluble vitamins was added and biomarkers for other types of nutrients (e.g., fatty acids) and bioactive dietary compounds (e.g., phytoestrogens) were included in NHANES. The cross-sectional survey is flexible in design, and biomarkers may be measured for a short period of time or rotated in and out of surveys depending on scientific needs. Maintaining high-quality laboratory measurements over extended periods of time such that trends in status can be reliably assessed is a major goal of the testing laboratories. Physicians, health scientists, and policy makers rely on the NHANES reference data to compare the nutritional status of population groups, to assess the impact of various interventions, and to explore associations between nutritional status and health promotion or disease prevention. Focusing on the continuous NHANES, which started in 1999, this review uses a ‚Äúlessons learned‚Äù approach to present a series of challenges that are relevant to researchers measuring biomarkers in NHANES and beyond. Some of those challenges are the use of multiple related biomarkers instead of a single biomarker for a specific nutrient (e.g., folate, vitamin B-12, iron), adhering to special needs for specimen collection and handling to ensure optimum specimen quality (e.g., vitamin C, folate, homocysteine, iodine, polyunsaturated fatty acids), the retrospective use of long-term quality-control data to correct for assay shifts (e.g., vitamin D, vitamin B-12), and the proper planning for and interpretation of crossover studies to adjust for systematic method changes (e.g., folate, vitamin D, ferritin).},

	abstract = {Respiratory rate (RR) is an often underestimated and underreported vital sign with tremendous clinical value. As a predictor of cardiopulmonary arrest, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation or indicator of health state for example in COVID-19 patients, respiratory rate could be especially valuable in remote long-term patient monitoring, which is challenging to implement. Contactless devices for home use aim to overcome these challenges. In this study, the contactless Sleepiz One+‚Äârespiration monitor for home use during sleep was validated against the thoracic effort belt. The agreement of instantaneous breathing rate and breathing rate statistics between the Sleepiz One+‚Äâdevice and the thoracic effort belt was initially evaluated during a 20-min sleep window under controlled conditions (no body movement) on a cohort of 19 participants and secondly in a more natural setting (uncontrolled for body movement) during a whole night on a cohort of 139 participants. Excellent agreement was shown for instantaneous breathing rate to be within 3 breaths per minute (Brpm) compared to thoracic effort band with an accuracy of 100\% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.39 Brpm for the setting controlled for movement, and an accuracy of 99.5\% with a MAE of 0.48 Brpm for the whole night measurement, respectively. Excellent agreement was also achieved for the respiratory rate statistics over the whole night with absolute errors of 0.43, 0.39 and 0.67 Brpm for the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles, respectively. Based on these results we conclude that the Sleepiz One+‚Äâcan estimate instantaneous respiratory rate and its summary statistics at high accuracy in a clinical setting. Further studies are required to evaluate the performance in the home environment, however, it is expected that the performance is at similar level, as the measurement conditions for the Sleepiz One+‚Äâdevice are better at home than in a clinical setting.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify the differences between circadian rhythm (CR) metrics characterized by different mobile sensors and computational methods.
METHODS: We used smartphone tracking and daily survey data from 225 college student participants, applied four methods (survey construct automation, cosinor regression, non-parametric method, Fourier analysis) on two types of smartphone sensor data (GPS, accelerometer) to characterize CR. We explored the inter-relations among the extracted circadian metrics as well as between the circadian metrics and participants' self-reported mood and sleep outcomes.
RESULTS: Compared to GPS signals, smartphone accelerometer activity follows an intradaily distribution that starts earlier in the day, winds down later, reaches half cumulative activity about the same time, conforms less to a sinusoidal wave, and exhibits more intradaily fragmentation but higher CR strength and lower interdaily disruption. We found a notable negative correlation between intradaily variability and CR strength especially pronounced in GPS activity. Self-reported sleep and mood outcomes showed significant correlations with particular CR metrics.
CONCLUSIONS: We revealed significant inter-relations and discrepancies in the circadian metrics discovered from two smartphone sensors and four CR algorithms and their bearings on wellbeing indicators such as sleep quality and loneliness.},

	abstract = {Background
Mobile accelerometry is a powerful and promising option to capture long-term changes in gait in both clinical and real-world scenarios. Increasingly, gait parameters have demonstrated their value as clinical outcome parameters, but validation of these parameters in elderly patients is still limited.

Objective
The aim of this study was to implement a validation framework appropriate for elderly patients and representative of real-world settings, and to use this framework to test and improve algorithms for mobile accelerometry data in an orthogeriatric population.

Methods
Twenty elderly subjects wearing a 3D-accelerometer completed a parcours imitating a real-world scenario. High-definition video and mobile reference speed capture served to validate different algorithms.

Results
Particularly at slow gait speeds, relevant improvements in accuracy have been achieved. Compared to the reference the deviation was less than 1\% in step detection and less than 0.05 m/s in gait speed measurements, even for slow walking subjects ({\textless} 0.8 m/s).

Conclusion
With the described setup, algorithms for step and gait speed detection have successfully been validated in an elderly population and demonstrated to have improved performance versus previously published algorithms. These results are promising that long-term and/or real-world measurements are possible with an acceptable accuracy even in elderly frail patients with slow gait speeds.},

In order to translate the information from such high-volume data arising we propose the use of a Markov modelling approach which (i) naturally captures the notable square wave form observed in activity data along with heterogeneous ultradian variances over the circadian cycle of human activity, (ii) thresholds activity into different states in a probabilistic way while respecting time dependence and (iii) gives rise to circadian rhythm parameter estimates, based on probabilities of transitions between rest and activity, that are interpretable and of interest to circadian research.},

	abstract = {Age-related physiological changes in humans are linearly associated with age. Naturally, linear combinations of physiological measures trained to estimate chronological age have recently emerged as a practical way to quantify aging in the form of biological age. In this work, we used one-week long physical activity records from a 2003‚Äì2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to compare three increasingly accurate biological age models: the unsupervised Principal Components Analysis (PCA) score, a multivariate linear regression, and a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We found that the supervised approaches produce better chronological age estimations at the expense of a loss of the association between the aging acceleration and all-cause mortality. Consequently, we turned to the NHANES death register directly and introduced a novel way to train parametric proportional hazards models suitable for out-of-the-box implementation with any modern machine learning software. As a demonstration, we produced a separate deep CNN for mortality risks prediction that outperformed any of the biological age or a simple linear proportional hazards model. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the emerging potential of combined wearable sensors and deep learning technologies for applications involving continuous health risk monitoring and real-time feedback to patients and care providers.},

RFM showed better accuracy than the BMI and had fewer false negative cases of body fat-defined obesity among women and men. RFM reduced total obesity misclassification among all women and all men and, overall, among Mexican-Americans, European-Americans and African-Americans. In the population studied, the suggested RFM was more accurate than BMI to estimate whole-body fat percentage among women and men and improved body fat-defined obesity misclassification among American adult individuals of Mexican, European or African ethnicity.},

Moreover, over 30\% of normal weight individuals were cardiometabolically unhealthy. There was no significant race-by-BMI interaction, but there was a significant gender-by-BMI interaction, F(4,64)=3.812, P=0.008. Using BMI categories as the main indicator of health, an estimated 74‚Äâ936‚Äâ678 US adults are misclassified as cardiometabolically unhealthy or cardiometabolically healthy.

Another dividend is the feasibility of deriving confidence intervals for parameters of rhythmic components of known periods, readily drawn from the least squares procedure, stressing the importance of prior (external) information. Originally developed for the analysis of short and sparse data series, the extended cosinor has been further developed for the analysis of long time series, focusing both on rhythm detection and parameter estimation. Attention is given to the assumptions underlying the use of the cosinor and ways to determine whether they are satisfied. In particular, ways of dealing with non-stationary data are presented. Examples illustrate the use of the different cosinor-based methods, extending their application from the study of circadian rhythms to the mapping of broad time structures (chronomes).},

Of the 189 participants, 88 (46\%) experienced mood episodes during follow-up. The Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for potential confounders showed that a robust circadian activity rhythm, including midline-estimating statistic of rhythm (MESOR) and amplitude by cosinor analysis and 10 consecutive hours with the highest amplitude values (M10) by the nonparametric circadian rhythm analysis, was significantly associated with a decrease in mood episode relapses (per counts/min, hazard ratio [95\% confidence interval]: MESOR, 0.993 [0.988‚Äì0.997]; amplitude, 0.994 [0.988‚Äì0.999]; and M10, 0.996 [0.993‚Äì0.999]).

	abstract = {Background and objective:
Cosinor analysis, developed by Franz Hallberg and colleagues in the 1960s, allows for the fitting of a cosine curve to data of a known period. Cosinor analysis is frequently used in the analysis of biological rhythm data. While software exists to perform these analyses, we are not aware of any published SAS procedures or macros which would facilitate them.

Methods:
To meet this gap, we herein describe SAS macros which perform cosinor analyses that assume either normally or gamma distributed outcomes and fixed period. The macros can 1) produce datasets with cosinor parameters including acrophase, mesor, amplitude, nadir and test for rhythmicity 2) output datasets with fitted and observed values from the model, and 3) plot the resulting curve and underlying data.

Results:
We demonstrate the use of these macros with data from our research on circadian rhythms of heart rate and sleep in critically ill patients.

Conclusions:
Cosinor analysis provides a parsimonious and intuitive set of estimates to summarize periodic data. We are hopeful that the publication of our macro will allow a wider spectrum of users to avail themselves of this technique.},

	abstract = {Circadian disruption is common in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Understanding and treating circadian disruption in critical illness has significant potential to improve critical illness outcomes through improved cognitive, immune, cardiovascular, and metabolic function. Measurement of circadian alignment (i.e., circadian phase) can be resource-intensive as it requires frequent blood or urine sampling over 24 or more hours. Less cumbersome methods of assessing circadian alignment would advance investigations in this field. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of using continuous telemetry to assess diurnal variation in heart rate (HR) among medical ICU patients as a proxy for circadian alignment. In exploratory analyses, we tested for associations between misalignment of diurnal variation in HR and death during hospital admission. This was a prospective observational cohort study embedded within a prospective medical ICU biorepository. HR data were continuously collected (every 5 s) via telemetry systems for the duration of the medical ICU admission; the first 24 h of this data was analyzed. Patients were extensively characterized via medical record chart abstraction and patient interviews. Of the 56 patients with complete HR data, 48 (86\%) had a detectable diurnal variation. Of these patients with diurnal variation, 39 (81\%) were characterized as having the nadir of their HR outside of the normal range of 02:00‚Äì06:00 (‚Äúmisalignment‚Äù). Interestingly, no deaths occurred in the patients with normally aligned diurnal variation; in contrast, there were seven deaths (out of 39 patients) in patients who had misaligned diurnal variation in HR. In an exploratory analysis, we found that the odds ratio of death for misaligned vs. aligned patients was increased at 4.38; however, this difference was not statistically significant (95\% confidence interval 0.20‚Äì97.63). We conclude that diurnal variation in HR can be detected via continuous telemetric monitoring of critically ill patients. A majority of these patients with diurnal variation exhibited misalignment in their first 24 h of medical ICU admission. Exploratory analyses suggest possible associations between misalignment and death.},

Several methods have recently been implemented to investigate the rhythmicity of continuous data. However, in most cases, these need to be manually adapted to work with count data as well. Namely, non-negative integer data that are usually obtained by counting of specific events. Herein, we describe the implementation of RhythmCount, an open-source Python module specifically devoted to rhythmicity analysis of count data. RhythmCount combines the cosinor regression model with different count data models. The proposed implementation allows automatic identification of the most suitable model for a given dataset, assessment of different measures and parameters of the rhythmicity of the dataset, and production of publication-ready figures that can be used for a straightforward interpretation of the obtained results. We demonstrate an application of the proposed module in the analysis and comparison of the daily traffic trends during the COVID-19 epidemic with the daily traffic trends in normal (non-epidemic) conditions. RhythmCount is available at https://github.com/ninavelikajne/RhythmCount under the MIT license. The implementation reported in this paper corresponds to the software release v1.1.},

However, in order to increase reliability and replication of the research it is important to share data and results openly. In medicine, this is often difficult due to legal restrictions or to the fact that data collected from clinical trials is seen as very valuable and something that should be kept "in-house". In this paper, we therefore present PSYKOSE, a publicly shared dataset consisting of motor activity data collected from body sensors. The dataset contains data collected from patients with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, as well as symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and diminished motivation. In total, we have data from 22 patients with schizophrenia and 32 healthy control persons. For each person in the dataset, we provide sensor data collected over several days in a row. In addition to the sensor data, we also provide some demographic data and medical assessments during the observation period. The patients were assessed by medical experts from Haukeland University hospital. In addition to the data, we provide a baseline analysis and possible use-cases of the dataset.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired disability (HAD) is common and often related to low physical activity while in the hospital.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether wearable hospital activity trackers can be used to predict HAD.
DESIGN: A prospective observational study between January 2016 and March 2017.
SETTING: An academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults, aged 60‚Äâyears or older, enrolled within 24‚Äâhours of admission to general medicine (n = 46).
MAIN MEASURES: Primary outcome was HAD, defined as having one or more new activity of daily living deficits, decline of four or greater on the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (calculated between baseline and discharge), or discharge to a skilled nursing facility. Hospital activity (mean active time, mean sedentary time, and mean step counts per day) was measured using ankle-mounted accelerometers. The association of the literature-based threshold of 900 steps/day with HAD was also evaluated.
RESULTS: Mean age was 73.2‚Äâyears (SD = 9.5‚Äâyears), 48\% were male, and 76\% were white. Median length of stay was 4‚Äâdays (interquartile range [IQR] =‚Äâ2.0-6.0‚Äâdays); 61\% (n = 28) reported being able to walk without assistance of another person or walking aid at baseline. Median daily activity time and step counts were 1.1 h/d (IQR = 0.7-1.7 h/d) and 1455.7 steps/day (IQR = 908.5-2643 steps/day), respectively. Those with HAD (41\%; n = 19) had lower activity time (0.8 vs 1.4 h/d; P = .04) and fewer step counts (1186 vs 1808 steps/day; P = .04), but no difference in sedentary time, compared to those without HAD. The 900 steps/day threshold had poor sensitivity (40\%) and high specificity (85\%) for detecting HAD.
CONCLUSIONS: Low hospital physical activity, as measured by wearable accelerometers, is associated with HAD. Clinicians can utilize wearable technology data to refer patients to physical/occupational therapy services or other mobility interventions, like walking programs.

	abstract = {Physical activity improves quality of life and protects against age-related diseases. With age, physical activity tends to decrease, increasing vulnerability to disease in the elderly. In the following, we trained a neural network to predict age from 115,456 one week-long 100Hz wrist accelerometer recordings from the UK Biobank (mean absolute error = 3.7¬±0.2 years), using a variety of data structures to capture the complexity of real-world activity. We achieved this performance by preprocessing the raw frequency data as 2,271 scalar features, 113 time series, and four images. We defined accelerated aging for a participant as being predicted older than one‚Äôs actual age and identified both genetic and environmental exposure factors associated with the new phenotype. We performed a genome wide association on the accelerated aging phenotypes to estimate its heritability (h\_g2 = 12.3¬±0.9\%) and identified ten single nucleotide polymorphisms in close proximity to genes in a histone and olfactory cluster on chromosome six (e.g HIST1H1C, OR5V1). Similarly, we identified biomarkers (e.g blood pressure), clinical phenotypes (e.g chest pain), diseases (e.g hypertension), environmental (e.g smoking), and socioeconomic (e.g income and education) variables associated with accelerated aging. Physical activity-derived biological age is a complex phenotype associated with both genetic and non-genetic factors., Physical activity improves quality of life and is also an important protective factor for prevalent age-related diseases and outcomes, such as diabetes and mortality. With age, physical activity tends to decrease, increasing vulnerability to disease in the elderly. Does physical activity measured from digital health devices predict one‚Äôs biological age? Biological age, as contrast to chronological age (the time that has elapsed since birth), is an indicator of the biological changes that accrue through time that are hypothesized to be one causal factor for age-related diseases. In the following, we trained machine learning models to predict age from 115,456 one week-long wrist accelerometer recordings from participants of the UK Biobank. We then found genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors associated with accelerated age, the difference between biological and chronological age, adding to the evidence of the biological plausibility of our new predictor. If reversable, summarizing complex physical activity into a biological age predictor may be a way of observing the effect of preventative efforts in real-time.},

	abstract = {To determine whether a machine learning model can detect SARS-CoV-2 infection from physiological metrics collected from wearable devices.Health care workers from 7 hospitals were enrolled and prospectively followed in a multicenter observational study. Subjects downloaded a custom smart phone app and wore Apple Watches for the duration of the study period. Daily surveys related to symptoms and the diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 were answered in the app.We enrolled 407 participants with 49 (12\%) having a positive nasal SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test during follow-up. We examined 5 machine-learning approaches and found that gradient-boosting machines (GBM) had the most favorable validation performance. Across all testing sets, our GBM model predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC) = 86.4\% (confidence interval [CI] 84‚Äì89\%). The model was calibrated to value sensitivity over specificity, achieving an average sensitivity of 82\% (CI ¬±‚àº4\%) and specificity of 77\% (CI ¬±‚àº1\%). The most important predictors included parameters describing the circadian heart rate variability mean (MESOR) and peak-timing (acrophase), and age.We show that a tree-based ML algorithm applied to physiological metrics passively collected from a wearable device can identify and predict SARS-CoV-2 infection.Applying machine learning models to the passively collected physiological metrics from wearable devices may improve SARS-CoV-2 screening methods and infection tracking.The goal of the study is to determine if SARS-CoV-2 infections, which cause Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), can be detected using machine learning algorithms applied to the information collected by wearable devices. Four hundred and nine health care workers were enrolled from 7 hospitals in New York City. Participants downloaded a custom smart phone application and were provided with an Apple Watch, if they did not have one of their own. Daily questions collected information from participants about how they feel and whether they were diagnosed with COVID-19. We found that a type of machine learning algorithm, called gradient boosting machines was able to reliably predict severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections by combining various metrics collected from the Apple Watch. We found markers of heart rate variability, or the calculation of the small-time differences between each heartbeat, to be important in identifying infections. These findings demonstrate that wearable devices may improve screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections and the overall tracking of infections.},

Biological age (BA) is, therefore, considered a more precise predictor of health status. We aimed to develop a BA prediction model from self-assessed risk factors and validate it as an indicator for predicting the risk of chronic disease. A total of 101,980 healthy participants from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study were included in this study. BA was computed based on body measurements, SES, lifestyle behaviors, and presence of comorbidities using elastic net regression analysis. The effects of BA on diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), combination of DM and HT, and chronic kidney disease were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. A younger BA was associated with a lower risk of DM (HR = 0.63, 95\% CI: 0.55‚Äì0.72), hypertension (HR = 0.74, 95\% CI: 0.68‚Äì0.81), and combination of DM and HT (HR = 0.65, 95\% CI: 0.47‚Äì0.91). The largest risk of disease was seen in those with a BA higher than their CA. A consistent association was also observed within the 5-year follow-up. BA, therefore, is an effective tool for detecting high-risk groups and preventing further risk of chronic diseases through individual and population-level interventions.},

	abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) fluctuates throughout the day. The pattern it follows represents one of the most important circadian rhythms in the human body. For example, morning BP surge has been suggested as a potential risk factor for cardiovascular events occurring in the morning, but the accurate quantification of this phenomenon remains a challenge. Here, we outline a novel method to quantify morning surge. We demonstrate how the most commonly used method to model 24-hour BP, the single cosinor approach, can be extended to a multiple-component cosinor random-effects model. We outline how this model can be used to obtain a measure of morning BP surge by obtaining derivatives of the model fit. The model is compared with a functional principal component analysis that determines the main components of variability in the data. Data from the Mitchelstown Study, a population-based study of Irish adults (n = 2047), were used where a subsample (1207) underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. We demonstrate that our 2-component model provided a significant improvement in fit compared with a single model and a similar fit to a more complex model captured by b-splines using functional principal component analysis. The estimate of the average maximum slope was 2.857 mmHg/30 min (bootstrap estimates; 95\% CI: 2.855-2.858 mmHg/30 min). Simulation results allowed us to quantify the between-individual SD in maximum slopes, which was 1.02 mmHg/30 min. By obtaining derivatives we have demonstrated a novel approach to quantify morning BP surge and its variation between individuals. This is the first demonstration of cosinor approach to obtain a measure of morning surge.},

	abstract = {Background: Between 2013 and 2015, the UK Biobank collected accelerometer traces from 103,712 volunteers aged between 40 and 69 years using wrist-worn triaxial accelerometers for 1 week. This data set has been used in the past to verify that individuals with chronic diseases exhibit reduced activity levels compared with healthy populations. However, the data set is likely to be noisy, as the devices were allocated to participants without a set of inclusion criteria, and the traces reflect free-living conditions.
Objective: This study aims to determine the extent to which accelerometer traces can be used to distinguish individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) from normoglycemic controls and to quantify their limitations.
Methods: Machine learning classifiers were trained using different feature sets to segregate individuals with T2D from normoglycemic individuals. Multiple criteria, based on a combination of self-assessment UK Biobank variables and primary care health records linked to UK Biobank participants, were used to identify 3103 individuals with T2D in this population. The remaining nondiabetic 19,852 participants were further scored on their physical activity impairment severity based on other conditions found in their primary care data, and those deemed likely physically impaired at the time were excluded. Physical activity features were first extracted from the raw accelerometer traces data set for each participant using an algorithm that extends the previously developed Biobank Accelerometry Analysis toolkit from Oxford University. These features were complemented by a selected collection of sociodemographic and lifestyle features available from UK Biobank.
Results: We tested 3 types of classifiers, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) close to 0.86 (95\% CI 0.85-0.87) for all 3 classifiers and F1 scores in the range of 0.80-0.82 for T2D-positive individuals and 0.73-0.74 for T2D-negative controls. Results obtained using nonphysically impaired controls were compared with highly physically impaired controls to test the hypothesis that nondiabetic conditions reduce classifier performance. Models built using a training set that included highly impaired controls with other conditions had worse performance (AUC 0.75-0.77; 95\% CI 0.74-0.78; F1 scores in the range of 0.76-0.77 for T2D positives and 0.63-0.65 for controls).
Conclusions: Granular measures of free-living physical activity can be used to successfully train machine learning models that are able to discriminate between individuals with T2D and normoglycemic controls, although with limitations because of the intrinsic noise in the data sets. From a broader clinical perspective, these findings motivate further research into the use of physical activity traces as a means of screening individuals at risk of diabetes and for early detection, in conjunction with routinely used risk scores, provided that appropriate quality control is enforced on the data collection protocol.},

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of five different machine-learning models for diabetes prediction using lifestyle data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. The 1999‚Äì2020 NHANES database yielded data on 17,833 individuals data based on demographic characteristics and lifestyle-related variables. To screen training data for machine models, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) forward propagation algorithm was utilized. For predicting diabetes, five machine-learning models (CATBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) were developed. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Among the five machine-learning models, the dietary intake levels of energy, carbohydrate, and fat, contributed the most to the prediction of diabetes patients. In terms of model performance, CATBoost ranks higher than RF, LG, XGBoost, and SVM. The best-performing machine-learning model among the five is CATBoost, which achieves an accuracy of 82.1\% and an AUC of 0.83. Machine-learning models based on NHANES data can assist medical institutions in identifying diabetes patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Depression is a prevalent mental disorder that is undiagnosed and untreated in half of all cases. Wearable activity trackers collect fine-grained sensor data characterizing the behavior and physiology of users (ie, digital biomarkers), which could be used for timely, unobtrusive, and scalable depression screening. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the predictive ability of digital biomarkers, based on sensor data from consumer-grade wearables, to detect risk of depression in a working population. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 290 healthy working adults. Participants wore Fitbit Charge 2 devices for 14 consecutive days and completed a health survey, including screening for depressive symptoms using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), at baseline and 2 weeks later. We extracted a range of known and novel digital biomarkers characterizing physical activity, sleep patterns, and circadian rhythms from wearables using steps, heart rate, energy expenditure, and sleep data. Associations between severity of depressive symptoms and digital biomarkers were examined with Spearman correlation and multiple regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders, including sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol consumption, smoking, self-rated health, subjective sleep characteristics, and loneliness. Supervised machine learning with statistically selected digital biomarkers was used to predict risk of depression (ie, symptom severity and screening status). We used varying cutoff scores from an acceptable PHQ-9 score range to define the depression group and different subsamples for classification, while the set of statistically selected digital biomarkers remained the same. For the performance evaluation, we used k-fold cross-validation and obtained accuracy measures from the holdout folds. Results: A total of 267 participants were included in the analysis. The mean age of the participants was 33 (SD 8.6, range 21-64) years. Out of 267 participants, there was a mild female bias displayed (n=170, 63.7\%). The majority of the participants were Chinese (n=211, 79.0\%), single (n=163, 61.0\%), and had a university degree (n=238, 89.1\%). We found that a greater severity of depressive symptoms was robustly associated with greater variation of nighttime heart rate between 2 AM and 4 AM and between 4 AM and 6 AM; it was also associated with lower regularity of weekday circadian rhythms based on steps and estimated with nonparametric measures of interdaily stability and autocorrelation as well as fewer steps-based daily peaks. Despite several reliable associations, our evidence showed limited ability of digital biomarkers to detect depression in the whole sample of working adults. However, in balanced and contrasted subsamples comprised of depressed and healthy participants with no risk of depression (ie, no or minimal depressive symptoms), the model achieved an accuracy of 80\%, a sensitivity of 82\%, and a specificity of 78\% in detecting subjects at high risk of depression. Conclusions: Digital biomarkers that have been discovered and are based on behavioral and physiological data from consumer wearables could detect increased risk of depression and have the potential to assist in depression screening, yet current evidence shows limited predictive ability. Machine learning models combining these digital biomarkers could discriminate between individuals with a high risk of depression and individuals with no risk.},

The package enables practitioners to easily compare interpretability algorithms by exposing multiple methods under a unified API, and by having a built-in, extensible visualization platform.

Monitoring national trends and correlates of sedentary behavior and physical inactivity can help identify patterns of risk in the population over time. Methods: The authors used self-reported data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2007/2008‚Äì2017/2018) to estimate trends in US adults‚Äô mean daily sitting time, overall, and stratified by levels of leisure-time and multidomain physical activity, and in the joint prevalence of high sitting time ({\textgreater}8 h/d) and physical inactivity. Trends were tested using orthogonal polynomial contrasts. Results: Overall, mean daily sitting time increased by 19 minutes from 2007/2008 (332 min/d) to 2017/2018 (351 min/d) (Plinear‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ.05; Pquadratic‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ.05). The highest point estimate occurred in 2013/2014 (426 min/d), with a decreasing trend observed after this point (Plinear‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ.05). Similar trends were observed across physical activity levels and domains, with one exception: an overall linear increase was not observed among sufficiently active adults. The mean daily sitting time was lowest among highly active adults compared with less active adults when using the multidomain physical activity measure. Conclusions: Sitting time among adults increased over the study period but decreased in recent years.},

	abstract = {Purpose Imprecise measurement of physical activity variables might attenuate estimates of the beneficial effects of activity on health-related outcomes. We aimed to compare the cardiometabolic risk factor dose-response relationships for physical activity and sedentary behaviour between accelerometer- and questionnaire-based activity measures. Methods Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were assessed in 317 adults by 7-day accelerometry and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Fasting blood was taken to determine insulin, glucose, triglyceride and total, LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations and homeostasis model-estimated insulin resistance (HOMAIR). Waist circumference, BMI, body fat percentage and blood pressure were also measured. Results For both accelerometer-derived sedentary time ({\textless}100 counts.min‚àí1) and IPAQ-reported sitting time significant positive (negative for HDL cholesterol) relationships were observed with all measured risk factors ‚Äì i.e. increased sedentary behaviour was associated with increased risk (all p‚â§0.01). However, for HOMAIR and insulin the regression coefficients were {\textgreater}50\% lower for the IPAQ-reported compared to the accelerometer-derived measure (p{\textless}0.0001 for both interactions). The relationships for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and risk factors were less strong than those observed for sedentary behaviours, but significant negative relationships were observed for both accelerometer and IPAQ MVPA measures with glucose, and insulin and HOMAIR values (all p{\textless}0.05). For accelerometer-derived MVPA only, additional negative relationships were seen with triglyceride, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations, BMI, waist circumference and percentage body fat, and a positive relationship was evident with HDL cholesterol (p = 0.0002). Regression coefficients for HOMAIR, insulin and triglyceride were 43‚Äì50\% lower for the IPAQ-reported compared to the accelerometer-derived MVPA measure (all p‚â§0.01). Conclusion Using the IPAQ to determine sitting time and MVPA reveals some, but not all, relationships between these activity measures and metabolic and vascular disease risk factors. Using this self-report method to quantify activity can therefore underestimate the strength of some relationships with risk factors.},

Currently, there is a wide range of assessment tools available, including subjective and objective measures. This study compared accelerometer-based estimates of PA with self-report PA data in older adults. Additionally, the associations between PA and health outcomes and PA profiles were analyzed. Participants (n = 110) wore a Xiaomi Mi Band 2¬Æ for fifteen consecutive days. Self-reported PA was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS). The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to compare self-reported and accelerometer-measured PA and associations between PA and health. Bland‚ÄìAltman plots were performed to assess the agreement between methods. Results highlight a large variation between self-reported and Xiaomi Mi Band 2¬Æ estimates, with poor general agreement. The highest difference was found for sedentary time. Low positive correlations were observed for IPAQ estimates (sedentary, vigorous, and total PA) and moderate for YPAS vigorous estimates. Finally, self-reported and objectively measured PA associated differently with health outcomes. Summarily, although accelerometry has the advantage of being an accurate method, self-report questionnaires could provide valuable information about the context of the activity.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence is a broad branch of computer science that has garnered significant interest in the field of medicine because of its problem solving, decision making and pattern recognition abilities. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, hones in on the ability of computers to receive data and learn for themselves, manipulating algorithms as they organize the information they are processing. Dermatology is at a particular advantage in the implementation of machine learning due to the availability of large clinical image databases that can be used for machine training and interpretation. While numerous studies have implemented machine learning in the diagnostic aspect of dermatology, less research has been conducted on the use of machine learning in predicting long-term outcomes in skin disease, with only a few studies published to date. Such an approach would assist physicians in selecting the best treatment methods, save patients‚Äô time, reduce treatment costs and improve the quality of treatment overall by reducing the amount of trial-and-error in the treatment process. In this review, we aim to provide a brief and relevant introduction to basic artificial intelligence processes, and to consolidate and examine the published literature on the use of machine learning in predicting clinical outcomes in dermatology.},

Modern society presents a host of challenges that can impair and disrupt critical circadian rhythms that reinforce optimal physiological functioning, including the proper timing and consolidation of sleep. While the acute effects of inadequate sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms are being defined, the adverse developmental consequences of disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms are understudied. Here, we exposed mice to disrupting light‚Äìdark cycles from birth until weaning and demonstrate that such exposure has adverse impacts on brain and behavior as adults. Mice that experience early-life circadian disruption exhibit more anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze, poorer spatial memory in the Morris Water Maze, and impaired working memory in a delayed match-to-sample task. Additionally, neuron morphology in the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex is adversely impacted. Pyramidal cells in these areas had smaller dendritic fields, and pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus also exhibited diminished branching orders. Disrupted mice were also hyperactive as adults, but otherwise exhibited no alteration in adult circadian locomotor rhythms. These results highlight that circadian disruption early in life may have long lasting and far-reaching consequences for the development of behavior and the brain.},

	abstract = {Background: Sleep and circadian disruption (SCD) is common and severe in the ICU. On the basis of rigorous evidence in non-ICU populations and emerging evidence in ICU populations, SCD is likely to have a profound negative impact on patient outcomes. Thus, it is urgent that we establish research priorities to advance understanding of ICU SCD.

Methods: We convened a multidisciplinary group with relevant expertise to participate in an American Thoracic Society Workshop. Workshop objectives included identifying ICU SCD subtopics of interest, key knowledge gaps, and research priorities. Members attended remote sessions from March to November 2021. Recorded presentations were prepared and viewed by members before Workshop sessions. Workshop discussion focused on key gaps and related research priorities. The priorities listed herein were selected on the basis of rank as established by a series of anonymous surveys.

Results: We identified the following research priorities: establish an ICU SCD definition, further develop rigorous and feasible ICU SCD measures, test associations between ICU SCD domains and outcomes, promote the inclusion of mechanistic and patient-centered outcomes within large clinical studies, leverage implementation science strategies to maximize intervention fidelity and sustainability, and collaborate among investigators to harmonize methods and promote multisite investigation.

Conclusions: ICU SCD is a complex and compelling potential target for improving ICU outcomes. Given the influence on all other research priorities, further development of rigorous, feasible ICU SCD measurement is a key next step in advancing the field.},

	abstract = {Misalignment of the endogenous circadian timing system leads to disruption of physiological rhythms and may contribute to the development of the deleterious health effects associated with night shift work. However, the molecular underpinnings remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect of a 4-day simulated night shift work protocol on the circadian regulation of the human transcriptome. Repeated blood samples were collected over two 24-hour measurement periods from eight healthy subjects under highly controlled laboratory conditions before and 4 days after a 10-hour delay of their habitual sleep period. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells to obtain transcriptomic data. Cosinor analysis revealed a marked reduction of significantly rhythmic transcripts in the night shift condition compared with baseline at group and individual levels. Subsequent analysis using a mixed-effects model selection approach indicated that this decrease is mainly due to dampened rhythms rather than to a complete loss of rhythmicity: 73\% of transcripts rhythmically expressed at baseline remained rhythmic during the night shift condition with a similar phase relative to habitual bedtimes, but with lower amplitudes. Functional analysis revealed that key biological processes are affected by the night shift protocol, most notably the natural killer cell-mediated immune response and Jun/AP1 and STAT pathways. These results show that 4 days of simulated night shifts leads to a loss in temporal coordination between the human circadian transcriptome and the external environment and impacts biological processes related to the adverse health effects associated to night shift work.},

	abstract = {{\textless}br{\textgreater}\textbf{Background:} Light at night (LAN) threatens metabolic health by delaying our sleep timing and allowing us to eat at odds with our circadian clocks. Circadian research interests are majorly focused on jet lags, shift work, and the non-24-h days. Since exposure to LAN, sleep loss, and late night eating are common scenarios of modern-day circadian rhythm disruption, developing an animal model that better mirrors these scenarios and investigation of their diabetogenic potentials is a research priority. \textbf{Materials and Methods:} Over the course of 6 weeks, we developed chronic LAN exposure (LAN), sleep restriction (SR), abnormal feeding (AF), rural social jetlag (RSJ), night shift work (NSW), and urban social jetlag (USJ) models, using male Wistar rats. Gentle handling was used to induce SR, while LAN was instituted using a customized light rack system. Circadian and blood glucose rhythms were, respectively, determined using 4 hourly temperature and blood glucose measurements. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS V20.0 and √íCosinor Software√ì. The data were summarized using mean ¬± standard deviation as well as MESoRs, amplitudes, and acrophases. Statistical significance was considered as \textit{P} ‚â§ 0.05. \textbf{Results:} Our findings have revealed a significantly (\textit{P} {\textless} 0.01) higher average nocturnal glucose (126 mg/dL) and temperature (36.53¬∞C) rhythms compared to diurnal glucose (108 mg/dL) and temperature (35.50¬∞C) rhythms in the controls rats. All the developed models are noted to have a distorted light: dark glucose and temperature rhythms with acrophases of the core body temperature in controls, RSJ and USJ models occurring at 08:16 pm, 2:43 pm, and 7:48 pm local time, respectively. The vector components of the phase changes revealed 5 h phase delay in the LAN model and 28 min, 1 h, and 4.5 h phase advancements among the USJ, AF, and SR models, respectively. These indicate circadian disruption and blood glucose dysrhythmia among the SR, AF, LAN, RSJ, USJ, and NSW models. \textbf{Conclusion:} Our findings have suggested the circadian disruptive and diabetogenic nature of our widespread modern-day social behaviors.{\textless}br{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background
Rest-activity rhythm (RAR), a manifestation of circadian rhythms, has been associated with morbidity and mortality risk. However, RAR patterns in the general population and specifically the role of demographic characteristics in RAR pattern have not been comprehensively assessed. Therefore, we aimed to describe RAR patterns among non-institutionalized US adults and age, sex, and race/ethnicity variation using accelerometry data from a nationally representative population.

Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted using the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011‚Äì2014. Participants aged ‚â•20‚Äâyears who were enrolled in the physical activity monitoring examination and had at least four 24-h periods of valid wrist accelerometer data were included in the present analysis. 24-h RAR metrics were generated using both extended cosinor model (amplitude, mesor, acrophase and pseudo-F statistic) and nonparametric methods (interdaily stability [IS] and intradaily variability [IV]). Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the association between RAR and age, sex, and race/ethnicity.

Results
Eight thousand two hundred participants (mean [SE] age, 49.1 [0.5] years) were included, of whom 52.2\% were women and 67.3\% Whites. Women had higher RAR amplitude and mesor, and also more robust (pseudo-F statistic), more stable (higher IS) and less fragmented (lower IV) RAR (all P
trend‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001) than men. Compared with younger adults (20‚Äì39‚Äâyears), older adults (‚â•‚Äâ60‚Äâyears) exhibited reduced RAR amplitude and mesor, but more stable and less fragmented RAR, and also reached their peak activity earlier (advanced acrophase) (all P
trend‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001). Relative to other racial/ethnic groups, Hispanics had the highest amplitude and mesor level, and most stable (highest IS) and least fragmented (lowest IV) RAR pattern (P
trend‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001). Conversely, non-Hispanic blacks had the lowest peak activity level (lowest amplitude) and least stable (lowest IS) RAR pattern (all P
trend‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001).

Conclusions
In the general adult population, RAR patterns vary significantly according to sex, age and race/ethnicity. These results may reflect demographic-dependent differences in intrinsic circadian rhythms and may have important implications for understanding racial, ethnic, sex and other disparities in morbidity and mortality risk.

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms become less dominant and less regular with chronic-degenerative disease, such that to accurately assess these pathological conditions it is important to quantify not only periodic characteristics but also more irregular aspects of the corresponding time series. Novel data-adaptive techniques, such as singular spectrum analysis (SSA), allow for the decomposition of experimental time series, in a model-free way, into a trend, quasiperiodic components and noise fluctuations. We compared SSA with the traditional techniques of cosinor analysis and intradaily variability using 1-week continuous actigraphy data in young adults with acute insomnia and healthy age-matched controls. The findings suggest a small but significant delay in circadian components in the subjects with acute insomnia, i.e. a larger acrophase, and alterations in the day-to-day variability of acrophase and amplitude. The power of the ultradian components follows a fractal 1/f power law for controls, whereas for those with acute insomnia this power law breaks down because of an increased variability at the 90min time scale, reminiscent of Kleitman‚Äôs basic rest-activity (BRAC) cycles. This suggests that for healthy sleepers attention and activity can be sustained at whatever time scale required by circumstances, whereas for those with acute insomnia this capacity may be impaired and these individuals need to rest or switch activities in order to stay focused. Traditional methods of circadian rhythm analysis are unable to detect the more subtle effects of day-to-day variability and ultradian rhythm fragmentation at the specific 90min time scale.},

Relatively little is known about the circadian clock in tumors and its effect on surrounding healthy tissues. Therefore, we compared the 24-hr expression levels of key circadian clock genes in liver and kidney of healthy control mice with those of mice bearing C26 colorectal tumor metastases in the liver. Metastases were induced by injection of C26 colorectal carcinoma cells into the spleen. Subsequently, tumor, liver and kidney tissue was collected around the clock to compare circadian rhythmicity. Expression levels of five clock genes (Rev-ErbŒ±, Per1, Per2, Bmal1 and Cry1) and three clock-controlled genes (CCGs; Dbp, p21 and Wee1) were determined by qRT-PCR. Liver and kidney tissue of healthy control mice showed normal 24-hr oscillations of all clock genes and CCGs, consistent with normal circadian rhythmicity. In colorectal liver metastases, however, 24-hr oscillations were completely absent for all clock genes and CCGs except Cry1. Liver and kidney tissue of tumor-bearing mice showed a shift in clock periodicity relative to control mice. In the liver we observed a phase advance, whereas in the kidney the phase was delayed. These data show that hepatic metastases of C26 colon carcinoma with a disrupted circadian rhythm phase shift liver and kidney tissue clocks, which strongly suggests a systemic effect on peripheral clocks. The possibility that tumors may modify peripheral clocks to escape from ordinary circadian rhythms and in this way contribute to fatigue and sleep disorders in cancer patients is discussed.},

	abstract = {There is emerging evidence that circadian misalignment may alter energy expenditure, leading to obesity risk among those with irregular schedules [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. It has been reported that energy expenditure is affected by the timing of sleep, exercise, and meals [6]. However, it is unclear whether the circadian system also modulates energy expenditure, independent of behavioral state and food intake. Here, we used a forced desynchrony protocol to examine whether fasted resting energy expenditure (REE) varies with circadian phase in seven participants. This protocol allowed us to uncouple sleep-wake and activity-related effects from the endogenous circadian rhythm, demonstrating that REE varies by circadian phase. REE is lowest at circadian phase ‚àº0¬∞, corresponding to the endogenous core body temperature (CBT) nadir in the late biological night, and highest at circadian phase ‚àº180¬∞ in the biological afternoon and evening. Furthermore, we found that respiratory quotient (RQ), reflecting macronutrient utilization, also varies by circadian phase. RQ is lowest at circadian phase ‚àº240¬∞ and highest at circadian phase ‚àº60¬∞, which corresponds to biological morning. This is the first characterization of a circadian profile in fasted resting energy expenditure and fasted respiratory quotient (with rhythmic profiles in both carbohydrate and lipid oxidation), decoupled from effects of activity, sleep-wake cycle, and diet in humans. The rhythm in energy expenditure and macronutrient metabolism may contribute to greater weight gain in shift workers and others with irregular schedules.},

	abstract = {Background:

Circadian rhythms play an essential role in physiological function. The molecular clock that underlies circadian physiological function consists of a core group of transcription factors, including the protein PER1 (Period1). Studies in mice show that PER1 plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure and renal sodium handling; however, the results are dependent on the strain being studied. Using male Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats with global knockout of PER1 (SSPer1‚àí/‚àí), we aim to test the hypothesis that PER1 plays a key role in the regulation of salt-sensitive blood pressure.

Methods:

The model was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 and was characterized using radiotelemetry and measures of renal function and circadian rhythm.

Results:

SSPer1‚àí/‚àí rats had similar mean arterial pressure when fed a normal 0.4\% NaCl diet but developed augmented hypertension after three weeks on a high-salt (4\% NaCl) diet. Despite being maintained on a normal 12:12 light:dark cycle, SSPer1‚àí/‚àí rats exhibited desynchrony mean arterial pressure rhythms on a high-salt diet, as evidenced by increased variability in the time of peak mean arterial pressure. SSPer1‚àí/‚àí rats excrete less sodium after three weeks on the high-salt diet. Furthermore, SSPer1‚àí/‚àí rats exhibited decreased creatinine clearance, a measurement of renal function, as well as increased signs of kidney tissue damage. SSPer1‚àí/‚àí rats also exhibited higher plasma aldosterone levels.

Conclusions:

Altogether, our findings demonstrate that loss of PER1 in Dahl SS rats causes an array of deleterious effects, including exacerbation of the development of salt-sensitive hypertension and renal damage.},

The objectives of this study were to determine whether flight attendants are more likely than teachers (comparison group) to experience circadian disruption, as measured by melatonin production, and to identify metrics of circadian disruption for epidemiologic studies of reproductive health in which biomonitoring is infeasible. Methods Each day, for one menstrual cycle, 45 flight attendants and 26 teachers kept a daily diary, collected and measured their overnight urine, and wore an activity monitor to assess sleep displacement. The relation between melatonin production and flight attendant and teacher status was analyzed with linear and multiple logistic regression. The relation between sleep displacement, melatonin, and flight-history-derived variables (including time zones crossed) were examined with exploratory factor analyses. Results Flight attendants experience increased circadian disruption, as measured by a higher adjusted melatonin rate variance, than teachers [2.8 x 10 5 versus 1.0 x 10 5 (ng/hour) 2 , respectively; P= 0.04] and are more likely to be in the highest quartile of melatonin variance (odds ratio 2.3; 95\% confidence interval 0.6-9.1). In the factor analysis, the number of time zones crossed was related to both melatonin desynchronization and sleep displacement. Conclusions Flight attendants experience increased circadian disruption, as measured by more variable melatonin rates, than a minimally flying comparison group. For epidemiologic studies of flight crews in which melatonin measurement is infeasible, the number of time zones crossed is a useful indicator of both sleep displacement and melatonin desynchronization.},

Increasing BT and HR mean values and declining 24-h BT and HR amplitudes accompany adverse changes in metabolic state. Increased nocturnal BT and a phase delay of the 24-h BT rhythm, deviant 24-h HR profile and a phase advance of the 24-h HR and FBG rhythms are early signs of the PD metabolic state. In T2DM, the 24-h FBG rhythm is no longer detectable, and the 24-h amplitudes of BT and HR are greatly diminished. In addition, lepton and creatinine values were lowered in T2DM. Moreover, positive correlations between FBG and body mass index, BMI, and negative correlations between the 24-h amplitude of FBG and BMI indicate that overweight is an additional factor causing disruption of the circadian rhythms. Further studies on circadian disruption as a consequence of metabolic dysfunction are necessary.

              Summary
              Circadian oscillations of gene expression regulate daily physiological processes, and their disruption is linked to many diseases. Circadian rhythms can be disrupted in a variety of ways, including differential phase, amplitude and rhythm fitness. Although many differential circadian biomarker detection methods have been proposed, a workflow for systematic detection of multifaceted differential circadian characteristics with accurate false positive control is not currently available. We propose a comprehensive and interactive pipeline to capture the multifaceted characteristics of differentially rhythmic biomarkers. Analysis outputs are accompanied by informative visualization and interactive exploration. The workflow is demonstrated in multiple case studies and is extensible to general omics applications.

	abstract = {Background
              Cough represents a cardinal symptom of acute respiratory tract infections. Generally associated with disease activity, cough holds biomarker potential and might be harnessed for prognosis and personalised treatment decisions. Here, we tested the suitability of cough as a digital biomarker for disease activity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other lower respiratory tract infections.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted a single-centre, exploratory, observational cohort study on automated cough detection in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 (n=32) and non-COVID-19 pneumonia (n=14) between April and November 2020 at the Cantonal Hospital St Gallen, Switzerland. Cough detection was achieved using smartphone-based audio recordings coupled to an ensemble of convolutional neural networks. Cough levels were correlated to established markers of inflammation and oxygenation.
            
            
              Measurements and main results
              Cough frequency was highest upon hospital admission and declined steadily with recovery. There was a characteristic pattern of daily cough fluctuations, with little activity during the night and two coughing peaks during the day. Hourly cough counts were strongly correlated with clinical markers of disease activity and laboratory markers of inflammation, suggesting cough as a surrogate of disease in acute respiratory tract infections. No apparent differences in cough evolution were observed between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Automated, quantitative, smartphone-based detection of cough is feasible in hospitalised patients and correlates with disease activity in lower respiratory tract infections. Our approach allows for near real-time telemonitoring of individuals in aerosol isolation. Larger trials are warranted to decipher the use of cough as a digital biomarker for prognosis and tailored treatment in lower respiratory tract infections.},

	abstract = {Background
Circadian clock alterations were poorly reported in trauma patients, although they have a critical role in human physiology. Core body temperature is a clinical variable regulated by the circadian clock. Our objective was to identify the circadian temperature disruption in trauma patients and to determine whether these disruptions were associated with the 28-day mortality rate.

Methods
A retrospective and observational single-center cohort study was conducted. All adult severe trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Aix Marseille University, North Hospital, from November 2013 to February 2018, were evaluated. The variations of core body temperature for each patient were analyzed between days 2 and 3 after intensive care unit admission. Core body temperature variations were defined by three parameters: mesor, amplitude, and period. A logistic regression model was used to determine the variables influencing these three parameters. A survival analysis was performed assessing the association between core body temperature rhythm disruption and 28-day mortality rate. A post hoc subgroup analysis focused on the patients with head trauma.

Results
Among the 1584 screened patients, 248 were included in this study. The period differed from 24‚Äâh in 177 (71\%) patients. The mesor value (¬∞C) was associated with body mass index and ketamine use. Amplitude (¬∞C) was associated with ketamine use only. The 28-day mortality rate was 18\%. For all trauma patients, age, body mass index, intracranial hypertension, and amplitude were independent risk factors. The patients with a mesor value {\textless}‚Äâ36.9‚Äâ¬∞C (p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001) and an amplitude {\textgreater}‚Äâ0.6‚Äâ¬∞C (p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001) had a higher 28-day mortality rate. Among the patients with head trauma, mesor and amplitude were identified as independent risk factors (HR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.40, 95\% CI [0.23‚Äì0.70], p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001 and HR‚Äâ=‚Äâ4.73, 95\% CI [1.38‚Äì16.22], p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01).

Conclusions
Our results highlight an association between core body temperature circadian alteration and 28-day mortality rate. This association was more pronounced in the head trauma patients than in the non-head trauma patients. Further studies are needed to show a causal link and consider possible interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: Clinical deterioration can go unnoticed in hospital wards for hours. Mobile technologies such as wearables and smartphones enable automated, continuous, noninvasive ward monitoring and allow the detection of subtle changes in vital signs. Cough can be effectively monitored through mobile technologies in the ward, as it is not only a symptom of prevalent respiratory diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, and COVID-19 but also a predictor of acute health deterioration. In past decades, many efforts have been made to develop an automatic cough counting tool. To date, however, there is neither a standardized, sufficiently validated method nor a scalable cough monitor that can be deployed on a consumer-centric device that reports cough counts continuously. These shortcomings limit the tracking of coughing and, consequently, hinder the monitoring of disease progression in prevalent respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and COVID-19 in the ward.
Objective: This exploratory study involved the validation of an automated smartphone-based monitoring system for continuous cough counting in 2 different modes in the ward. Unlike previous studies that focused on evaluating cough detection models on unseen data, the focus of this work is to validate a holistic smartphone-based cough detection system operating in near real time.
Methods: Automated cough counts were measured consistently on devices and on computers and compared with cough and noncough sounds counted manually over 8-hour long nocturnal recordings in 9 patients with pneumonia in the ward. The proposed cough detection system consists primarily of an Android app running on a smartphone that detects coughs and records sounds and secondarily of a backend that continuously receives the cough detection information and displays the hourly cough counts. Cough detection is based on an ensemble convolutional neural network developed and trained on asthmatic cough data.
Results: In this validation study, a total of 72 hours of recordings from 9 participants with pneumonia, 4 of whom were infected with SARS-CoV-2, were analyzed. All the recordings were subjected to manual analysis by 2 blinded raters. The proposed system yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 72\% and 99\% on the device and 82\% and 99\% on the computer, respectively, for detecting coughs. The mean differences between the automated and human rater cough counts were ‚àí1.0 (95\% CI ‚àí12.3 to 10.2) and ‚àí0.9 (95\% CI ‚àí6.5 to 4.8) coughs per hour within subject for the on-device and on-computer modes, respectively.
Conclusions: The proposed system thus represents a smartphone cough counter that can be used for continuous hourly assessment of cough frequency in the ward.},

	abstract = {Healthy individuals exhibit blood pressure variation over a 24-hour period with higher blood pressure during wakefulness and lower blood pressure during sleep. Loss or disruption of the blood pressure circadian rhythm has been linked to adverse health outcomes, for example, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and chronic kidney disease. However, the current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches lack sufficient attention to the circadian rhythmicity of blood pressure. Sleep patterns, hormone release, eating habits, digestion, body temperature, renal and cardiovascular function, and other important host functions as well as gut microbiota exhibit circadian rhythms, and influence circadian rhythms of blood pressure. Potential benefits of nonpharmacologic interventions such as meal timing, and pharmacologic chronotherapeutic interventions, such as the bedtime administration of antihypertensive medications, have recently been suggested in some studies. However, the mechanisms underlying circadian rhythm-mediated blood pressure regulation and the efficacy of chronotherapy in hypertension remain unclear. This review summarizes the results of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop convened on October 27 to 29, 2021 to assess knowledge gaps and research opportunities in the study of circadian rhythm of blood pressure and chronotherapy for hypertension.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous phenomena that recur daily in a self-sustaining, entrainable, and oscillatory manner, and orchestrate a wide range of molecular, physiological, and behavioral processes. Circadian clocks are comprised of a hierarchical network of central and peripheral clocks that generate, sustain, and synchronize the circadian rhythms. The functioning of the peripheral clock is regulated by signals from autonomic innervation (from the central clock), endocrine networks, feeding, and other external cues. The critical role played by circadian rhythms in maintaining both systemic and tissue-level homeostasis is well established, and disruption of the rhythm has direct consequence for human health, disorders, and diseases. Circadian oscillations in both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic processes are¬†known to affect efficacy and toxicity of several therapeutic agents. A variety of modeling approaches ranging from empirical to more complex systems modeling approaches have been applied to characterize circadian biology and its influence on drug actions, optimize time of dosing, and identify opportunities for pharmacological modulation of the clock mechanisms and their downstream effects. In this review, we summarize current understanding of circadian rhythms and its influence on physiology, pharmacology, and therapeutic interventions, and discuss the role of chronopharmacometrics in gaining new insights into circadian rhythms and its applications in chronopharmacology.},

Cell-autonomous clocks exist in almost all cells of the body and their timing is set by a variety of internal and external signals, including hormones and dietary intake. Improved understanding of the relationship between molecular clocks and exercise will benefit professional athletes and public health guidelines for the general population.

In a 14-day circadian paradigm, we assessed glycemic control during simulated night work with either nighttime or daytime eating. Assessment of central (body temperature) and peripheral (glucose and insulin) endogenous circadian rhythms happened during constant routine protocols before and after simulated night work. Nighttime eating led to misalignment between central and peripheral (glucose) endogenous circadian rhythms and impaired glucose tolerance, whereas restricting meals to daytime prevented it.

Sensitive, specific identification of diseases using blood samples would facilitate early recognition. We explored the potential of disease identification in high dimensional blood microRNA (miRNA) datasets using a powerful data reduction method: principal component analysis (PCA). Using Qlucore Omics Explorer (QOE), a dynamic, interactive visualization-guided bioinformatics program with a built-in statistical platform, we analyzed publicly available blood miRNA datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) maintained at the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The miRNA expression profiles were generated from real time PCR arrays, microarrays or next generation sequencing of biologic materials (e.g., blood, serum or blood components such as platelets). PCA identified the top three principal components that distinguished cohorts of patients with specific diseases (e.g., heart disease, stroke, hypertension, sepsis, diabetes, specific types of cancer, HIV, hemophilia, subtypes of meningitis, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, mild cognitive impairment, aging, and autism), from healthy subjects. Literature searches verified the functional relevance of the discriminating miRNAs. Our goal is to assemble PCA and heatmap analyses of existing and future blood miRNA datasets into a clinical reference database to facilitate the diagnosis of diseases using routine blood draws.},

Flexible, bidirectional and real-time control of communication allows development of a rich set of healthcare applications that can provide interactivity with the participant and adapt dynamically to their changing environment. Additionally, smartwatches have a variety of sensors suitable for collecting physical activity and location data. The combination of all these features makes it possible to transmit the collected data to a remote server, and thus, to monitor physical activity and potentially social activity in real time. As smartwatches exhibit high user acceptability and increasing popularity, they are ideal devices for monitoring activities for extended periods of time to investigate the physical activity patterns in free-living condition and their relationship with the seemingly random occurring illnesses, which have remained a challenge in the current literature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a smartwatch-based framework for real-time and online assessment and mobility monitoring (ROAMM). The proposed ROAMM framework will include a smartwatch application and server. The smartwatch application will be used to collect and preprocess data. The server will be used to store and retrieve data, remote monitor, and for other administrative purposes. With the integration of sensor-based and user-reported data collection, the ROAMM framework allows for data visualization and summary statistics in real-time.},

	abstract = {Background: New fitness trackers and smartwatches are released to the consumer market every year. These devices are equipped with different sensors, algorithms, and accompanying mobile apps. With recent advances in mobile sensor technology, privately collected physical activity data can be used as an addition to existing methods for health data collection in research. Furthermore, data collected from these devices have possible applications in patient diagnostics and treatment. With an increasing number of diverse brands, there is a need for an overview of device sensor support, as well as device applicability in research projects. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the availability of wrist-worn fitness wearables and analyze availability of relevant fitness sensors from 2011 to 2017. Furthermore, the study was designed to assess brand usage in research projects, compare common brands in terms of developer access to collected health data, and features to consider when deciding which brand to use in future research. Methods: We searched for devices and brand names in six wearable device databases. For each brand, we identified additional devices on official brand websites. The search was limited to wrist-worn fitness wearables with accelerometers, for which we mapped brand, release year, and supported sensors relevant for fitness tracking. In addition, we conducted a Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) and ClinicalTrials search to determine brand usage in research projects. Finally, we investigated developer accessibility to the health data collected by identified brands. Results: We identified 423 unique devices from 132 different brands. Forty-seven percent of brands released only one device. Introduction of new brands peaked in 2014, and the highest number of new devices was introduced in 2015. Sensor support increased every year, and in addition to the accelerometer, a photoplethysmograph, for estimating heart rate, was the most common sensor. Out of the brands currently available, the five most often used in research projects are Fitbit, Garmin, Misfit, Apple, and Polar. Fitbit is used in twice as many validation studies as any other brands and is registered in ClinicalTrials studies 10 times as often as other brands. Conclusions: The wearable landscape is in constant change. New devices and brands are released every year, promising improved measurements and user experience. At the same time, other brands disappear from the consumer market for various reasons. Advances in device quality offer new opportunities for research. However, only a few well-established brands are frequently used in research projects, and even less are thoroughly validated.},

Brain disorders such as autism, depression and Parkinson disease typically develop at certain stages of life, and circadian rhythms are important during each stage of life for the regulation of processes that may influence the development of these disorders. Here, we describe circadian disruptions observed in various brain disorders throughout the human lifespan and highlight emerging evidence suggesting these disruptions affect the brain. Currently, much of the evidence linking brain disorders and circadian dysfunction is correlational, and so whether and what kind of causal relationships might exist are unclear. We therefore identify remaining questions that may direct future research towards a better understanding of the links between circadian disruption and CNS disorders.},

	abstract = {An alarming rise in young onset colorectal cancer (CRC) has been reported; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains undefined. Suspected risk factors of young onset CRC include environmental aspects, such as lifestyle and dietary factors, which are known to affect the circadian clock. We find that both genetic disruption and environmental disruption of the circadian clock accelerate Apc-driven CRC pathogenesis in vivo. Using an intestinal organoid model, we demonstrate that clock disruption promotes transformation by driving Apc loss of heterozygosity, which hyperactivates Wnt signaling. This up-regulates c-Myc, a known Wnt target, which drives heightened glycolytic metabolism. Using patient-derived organoids, we show that circadian rhythms are lost in human tumors. Last, we identify that variance between core clock and Wnt pathway genes significantly predicts the survival of patients with CRC. Overall, our findings demonstrate a previously unidentified mechanistic link between clock disruption and CRC, which has important implications for young onset cancer prevention.},

	abstract = {Stress is an inevitable part of modern life. While stress can negatively impact a person's life and health, positive and under-controlled stress can also enable people to generate creative solutions to problems encountered in their daily lives. Although it is hard to eliminate stress, we can learn to monitor and control its physical and psychological effects. It is essential to provide feasible and immediate solutions for more mental health counselling and support programs to help people relieve stress and improve their mental health. Popular wearable devices, such as smartwatches with several sensing capabilities, including physiological signal monitoring, can alleviate the problem. This work investigates the feasibility of using wrist-based electrodermal activity (EDA) signals collected from wearable devices to predict people's stress status and identify possible factors impacting stress classification accuracy. We use data collected from wrist-worn devices to examine the binary classification discriminating stress from non-stress. For efficient classification, five machine learning-based classifiers were examined. We explore the classification performance on four available EDA databases under different feature selections. According to the results, Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms the other machine learning approaches with an accuracy of 92.9 for stress prediction. Additionally, when the subject classification included gender information, the performance analysis showed significant differences between males and females. We further examine a multimodal approach for stress classifications. The results indicate that wearable devices with EDA sensors have a great potential to provide helpful insight for improved mental health monitoring.},

	abstract = {Getting prompt insights about health and well-being in a non-invasive way is one of the most popular features available on wearable devices. Among all vital signs available, heart rate (HR) monitoring is one of the most important since other measurements are based on it. Real-time HR estimation in wearables mostly relies on photoplethysmography (PPG), which is a fair technique to handle such a task. However, PPG is vulnerable to motion artifacts (MA). As a consequence, the HR estimated from PPG signals is strongly affected during physical exercises. Different approaches have been proposed to deal with this problem, however, they struggle to handle exercises with strong movements, such as a running session. In this paper, we present a new method for HR estimation in wearables that uses an accelerometer signal and user demographics to support the HR prediction when the PPG signal is affected by motion artifacts. This algorithm requires a tiny memory allocation and allows on-device personalization since the model parameters are finetuned in real time during workout executions. Also, the model may predict HR for a few minutes without using a PPG, which represents a useful contribution to an HR estimation pipeline. We evaluate our model on five different exercise datasets ‚Äì performed on treadmills and in outdoor environments ‚Äì and the results show that our method can improve the coverage of a PPG-based HR estimator while keeping a similar error performance, which is particularly useful to improve user experience.},

	abstract = {Some wearable solutions exploiting on-body acceleration sensors have been proposed to recognize Freezing of Gait (FoG) in people affected by Parkinson Disease (PD). Once a FoG event is detected, these systems generate a sequence of rhythmic stimuli to allow the patient restarting the gait. While these solutions are effective in detecting FoG events, they are unable to predict FoG to prevent its occurrence. This paper fills in the gap by presenting a machine learning-based approach that classifies accelerometer data from PD patients, recognizing a pre-FOG phase to further anticipate FoG occurrence in advance. Gait was monitored by three tri-axial accelerometer sensors worn on the back, hip and ankle. Gait features were then extracted from the accelerometer's raw data through data windowing and non-linear dimensionality reduction. A k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) was used to classify gait in three classes of events: pre-FoG, no-FoG and FoG. The accuracy of the proposed solution was compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our study showed that: (i) we achieved performances overcoming the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of FoG detection, (ii) we were able, for the very first time in the literature, to predict FoG by identifying the pre-FoG events with an average sensitivity and specificity of, respectively, 94.1\% and 97.1\%, and (iii) our algorithm can be executed on resource-constrained devices. Future applications include the implementation on a mobile device, and the administration of rhythmic stimuli by a wearable device to help the patient overcome the FoG.},

The aim of this paper is to develop a sensor-based approach to health status measurement in order to objectively measure health status. Methods: Techniques to generate human behavior profiles, derived from the smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, are proposed. Experiments, using SVM regression models, are then conducted in order to evaluate the use of the proposed behavior profiles as a predictor of health status. Results: Experiments were conducted on data from 171 participants, with an average of 114 h of data per participant. Regression models were trained and tested on the 10 SF-36 self-ratings. Results showed that the eight individual SF-36 scales and two component scores could be predicted with an average correlation of 0.683 and 0.698, respectively. General health was predicted with an average correlation of 0.752. Conclusion: Research shows that the clinically important difference for SF-36 self-ratings are approximately 10 points. Health status prediction errors in this study were 11.7 points on average. While the problem has not been fully solved, this paper presents a hugely promising direction for health status prediction. Significance: Using the proposed techniques, health status could be measured using unobtrusive, inexpensive, and already available hardware. It could provide a means for clinicians to accurately and objectively assess the daily life benefits of treatments on an individual patient basis.},

	abstract = {Many studies have utilized physical activity for predicting mortality risk, using measures such as participant walk tests and self-reported walking pace. The rise of passive monitors to measure participant activity without requiring specific actions opens the possibility for population level analysis. We have developed novel technology for this predictive health monitoring, using limited sensor inputs. In previous studies, we validated these models in clinical experiments with carried smartphones, using only their embedded accelerometers as motion sensors. Using smartphones as passive monitors for population measurement is critically important for health equity, since they are already ubiquitous in high-income countries and increasingly common in low-income countries. Our current study simulates smartphone data by extracting walking window inputs from wrist worn sensors. To analyze a population at national scale, we studied 100,000 participants in the UK Biobank who wore activity monitors with motion sensors for 1 week. This national cohort is demographically representative of the UK population, and this dataset represents the largest such available sensor record. We characterized participant motion during normal activities, including daily living equivalent of timed walk tests. We then compute walking intensity from sensor data, as input to survival analysis. Simulating passive smartphone monitoring, we validated predictive models using only sensors and demographics. This resulted in C-index of 0.76 for 1-year risk decreasing to 0.73 for 5-year. A minimum set of sensor features achieves C-index of 0.72 for 5-year risk, which is similar accuracy to other studies using methods not achievable with smartphone sensors. The smallest minimum model uses average acceleration, which has predictive value independent of demographics of age and sex, similar to physical measures of gait speed. Our results show passive measures with motion sensors can achieve similar accuracy to active measures of gait speed and walk pace, which utilize physical walk tests and self-reported questionnaires., Healthcare infrastructure implementation could benefit tremendously from national scale screening with passive monitors. Large scale population data could delineate health risks without intruding into daily living. Digital health offers potential solutions if sensor devices of adequate accuracy for predictive models could be widely deployed. The only such current devices are cheap phones, smartphone devices with embedded accelerometers. This limits measures to motion sensor data collected when the phones are carried during normal activities. So measuring walking intensity is possible, but the total activity measure that is possible with 24-hour wearable devices is not. Our study simulates the use of smartphone sensors to predict mortality risk in the largest national cohort with sensor records, the demographically representative UK Biobank. Mortality is the most definitive outcome, with accurate death records for five years available for the 100,000 participants who wore sensor devices. We analyzed this dataset to extract walking sessions during daily living, then used characteristic motions of these walking sessions to predict mortality risk. The accuracy achieved was similar to activity monitors measuring total activity and even similar to physical measures such as gait speed during observed walks. Our scalable methods offer a feasible pathway towards national screening for health risk.},

Therefore, we aim to build a data-driven predictive application for screening subjects at a high risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the western region of Saudi Arabia. In this context, we designed and implemented a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study using conventional diabetes risk factors for studying the prevalence and the association between the outcomes and exposure (s). We used the Chi-Squared test and binary logistic regression to analyze and screen the most significant diabetes risk factor for T2DM risk prediction. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), a class-balancer, was used to balance the cross-sectional data. We used the balanced class data to screen the best performing classification algorithm to classify patients at high risk of diabetes with a higher F1 Score. The best performing classifier's hyper-parameters were further tuned using 10-fold cross-validation for achieving an improved F1 Score. Additionally, we validated our proposed model with the existing models built using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset and Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset. The results of the Chi-squared test and binary logistic regression showed that the exposures, namely Smoking, Healthy diet, Blood-Pressure (BP), Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Region, contributed significantly (p {\textless}; 0.05) to the prediction of the Response variable (subjects at high risk of diabetes). The tuned two-class Decision Forest (DF) model showed better performance with an average F1score of 0.8453 ¬± 0.0268. Moreover, the DF based model adapted reasonably well in different diabetes dataset. An Application Programming Interface (API) of the tuned DF model was implemented and deployed as a web service at https://type2-diabetes-risk-predictor.herokuapp.com, and the implementation codes are available at https://github.com/SAH-ML/T2DM-Risk-Predictor.},

The impact of regression algorithms on prediction accuracy in the brain age estimation frameworks have not been comprehensively evaluated. Here, we sought to assess the efficiency of different regression algorithms on brain age estimation. To this end, we built a brain age estimation framework based on a large set of cognitively healthy (CH) individuals (N = 788) as a training set followed by different regression algorithms (22 different algorithms in total). We then quantified each regression-algorithm on independent test sets composed of 88 CH individuals, 70 mild cognitive impairment patients as well as 30 Alzheimer‚Äôs disease patients. The prediction accuracy in the independent test set (i.e., CH set) varied in regression algorithms mean absolute error (MAE) from 4.63 to 7.14 yrs, R{\textasciicircum}2 from 0.76 to 0.88. The highest and lowest prediction accuracies were achieved by Quadratic Support Vector Regression algorithm (MAE = 4.63 yrs, R{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.88, 95\% CI = [-1.26, 1.42]) and Binary Decision Tree algorithm (MAE = 7.14 yrs, R{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.76, 95\% CI = [-1.50, 2.62]), respectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy in brain age frameworks is affected by regression algorithms, indicating that advanced machine learning algorithms can lead to more accurate brain age predictions in clinical settings.},

Recent advancements in wearable sensor technology and machine learning may provide a possibility for an individualized prediction of fall risk based on gait recordings from standardized gait tests or from unconstrained real-world scenarios. However, the most effective aggregation of continuous real-world data as well as the potential of unsupervised gait tests recorded over multiple days for fall risk prediction still need to be investigated. Therefore, we present a data set containing real-world gait and unsupervised 4x10-Meter-Walking-Tests of 40 PD patients, continuously recorded with foot-worn inertial sensors over a period of two weeks. In this prospective study, falls were self-reported during a three-month follow-up phase, serving as ground truth for fall risk prediction. The purpose of this study was to compare different data aggregation approaches and machine learning models for the prospective prediction of fall risk using gait parameters derived either from continuous real-world recordings or from unsupervised gait tests. The highest balanced accuracy of 74.0\% (sensitivity: 60.0\%, specificity: 88.0\%) was achieved with a Random Forest Classifier applied to the real-world gait data when aggregating all walking bouts and days of each participant. Our findings suggest that fall risk can be predicted best by merging the entire two-week real-world gait data of a patient, outperforming the prediction using unsupervised gait tests (68.0\% balanced accuracy) and contribute to an improved understanding of fall risk prediction.},

	abstract = {In a hospital, accurate and rapid mortality prediction of Length of Stay (LOS) is essential since it is one of the essential measures in treating patients with severe diseases. When predictions of patient mortality and readmission are combined, these models gain a new level of significance. Therefore, the most expensive components of patient care are LOS and readmission rates. Several studies have assessed readmission to the hospital as a single-task issue. The performance, robustness, and stability of the model increase when many correlated tasks are optimized. This study develops multimodal multitasking Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Learning (DL) model that can predict both LOS and readmission for patients using multi-sensory data from 47 patients. Continuous sensory data is divided into eight sections, each of which is recorded for an hour. The time steps are constructed using a dual 10-second window-based technique, resulting in six steps per hour. The 30 statistical features are computed by transforming the sensory input into the resulting vector. The proposed multitasking model predicts 30-day readmission as a binary classification problem and LOS as a regression task by constructing discrete time-step data based on the length of physical activity during a hospital stay. The proposed model is compared to a random forest for a single-task problem (classification or regression) because typical machine learning algorithms are unable to handle the multitasking challenge. In addition, sensory data combined with other cost-effective modalities such as demographics, laboratory tests, and comorbidities to construct reliable models for personalized, cost-effective, and medically acceptable prediction. With a high accuracy of 94.84\%, the proposed multitask multimodal DL model classifies the patient's readmission status and determines the patient's LOS in hospital with a minimal Mean Square Error (MSE) of 0.025 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.077, which is promising, effective, and trustworthy.},

Methods: We propose CovidRhythm, a novel Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Network with Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) that combines sensor and rhythmic features extracted from heart rate and activity (steps) data gathered passively using consumer-grade smart wearable to predict Covid-19. A total of 39 features were extracted (standard deviation, mean, min/max/avg length of sedentary and active bouts) from wearable sensor data. Biobehavioral rhythms were modeled using nine parameters (mesor, amplitude, acrophase, and intra-daily variability). These features were then input to CovidRhythm for predicting Covid-19 in the incubation phase (one day before biological symptoms manifest). Results: A combination of sensor and biobehavioral rhythm features achieved the highest AUC-ROC of 0.79 [Sensitivity = 0.69, Specificity = 0.89, F$_{\textrm{0.1}}$ = 0.76], outperforming prior approaches in discriminating Covid-positive patients from healthy controls using 24 hours of historical wearable physiological. Rhythmic features were the most predictive of Covid-19 infection when utilized either alone or in conjunction with sensor features. Sensor features predicted healthy subjects best. Circadian rest-activity rhythms that combine 24 h activity and sleep information were the most disrupted. Conclusions: CovidRhythm demonstrates that biobehavioral rhythms derived from consumer-grade wearable data can facilitate timely Covid-19 detection. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to detect Covid-19 using deep learning and biobehavioral rhythms features derived from consumer-grade wearable data.},

Due to the limited nature of older adult inertial gait datasets, we first pre-train the FCNN models using a publicly available dataset for pedestrian activity recognition. Then via transfer learning, we train the network for falls risk classification. We show that via transfer learning, our falls risk classifier obtains an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 93.3\%, which is 10.6\% higher than the equivalent model trained without the use of transfer learning. Additionally, we show that our method outperforms other standard machine learning classifiers trained on features developed in prior research.},

Levels of stress, anxiety, depression and general health were evaluated from subjective questionnaires completed on a weekly or twice-weekly basis by 652 participants.

	abstract = {Objectives
Comorbid depression is a highly prevalent and debilitating condition in middle-aged and elderly adults, particularly when associated with obesity, diabetes, and sleep disturbances. In this context, there is a growing need to develop efficient screening methods for cases based on clinical health markers for these comorbidities and sleep data. Thus, our objective was to detect depressive symptoms in these subjects, considering general biomarkers of obesity and diabetes and variables related to sleep and physical exercise through a machine learning approach.
Methods
We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2015‚Äì2016 data. Eighteen variables on self-reported physical activity, self-reported sleep habits, sleep disturbance indicative, anthropometric measurements, sociodemographic characteristics and plasma biomarkers of obesity and diabetes were selected as predictors. A total of 2907 middle-aged and elderly subjects were eligible for the study. Supervised learning algorithms such as Lasso penalized Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were implemented.
Results
XGBoost provided greater accuracy and precision (87\%), with a proportion of hits in cases with depressive symptoms above 80\%. In addition, daytime sleepiness was the most significant predictor variable for predicting depressive symptoms.
Conclusions
Sleep and physical activity variables, in addition to obesity and diabetes biomarkers, together assume significant importance to predict, with accuracy and precision of 87\%, the occurrence of depressive symptoms in middle-aged and elderly individuals.},

However, the ability to measure the biological aging process in individuals, which is necessary to test for efficacy of these interventions, remains largely inaccessible to the general public. Here we used NHANES physical activity accelerometer data from a wearable device and machine-learning algorithms to derive biological age predictions for individuals based on their movement patterns. We found that accelerated biological aging from our ‚ÄúMoveAge‚Äù predictor is associated with higher all-cause mortality. We further searched for nutritional or pharmacological compounds that associate with decelerated aging according to our model. A number of nutritional components peak in their association to decelerated aging later in life, including fiber, magnesium, and vitamin E. We additionally identified one FDA-approved drug associated with decelerated biological aging: the alpha-blocker doxazosin. We show that doxazosin extends healthspan and lifespan in C. elegans. Our work demonstrates how a biological aging score based on relative mobility can be accessible to the wider public and can potentially be used to identify and determine efficacy of geroprotective interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: Osteoporosis is one of the diseases that requires early screening and detection for its management. Common clinical tools and machine-learning (ML) models for screening osteoporosis have been developed, but they show limitations such as low accuracy. Moreover, these methods are confined to limited risk factors and lack individualized explanation.
Objective: The aim of this study was to develop an interpretable deep-learning (DL) model for osteoporosis risk screening with clinical features. Clinical interpretation with individual explanations of feature contributions is provided using an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique.
Methods: We used two separate data sets: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data sets from the United States (NHANES) and South Korea (KNHANES) with 8274 and 8680 respondents, respectively. The study population was classified according to the T-score of bone mineral density at the femoral neck or total femur. A DL model for osteoporosis diagnosis was trained on the data sets and significant risk factors were investigated with local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). The performance of the DL model was compared with that of ML models and conventional clinical tools. Additionally, contribution ranking of risk factors and individualized explanation of feature contribution were examined.
Results: Our DL model showed area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.851 (95\% CI 0.844-0.858) and 0.922 (95\% CI 0.916-0.928) for the femoral neck and total femur bone mineral density, respectively, using the NHANES data set. The corresponding AUC values for the KNHANES data set were 0.827 (95\% CI 0.821-0.833) and 0.912 (95\% CI 0.898-0.927), respectively. Through the LIME method, significant features were induced, and each feature‚Äôs integrated contribution and interpretation for individual risk were determined.
Conclusions: The developed DL model significantly outperforms conventional ML models and clinical tools. Our XAI model produces high-ranked features along with the integrated contributions of each feature, which facilitates the interpretation of individual risk. In summary, our interpretable model for osteoporosis risk screening outperformed state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Ageing has an effect on many parameters of the physical condition, and one of them is the way a person walks. This property, the gait pattern, can unintrusively be observed by letting people walk over a sensor floor. The electric capacitance sensors built into the floor deliver information about when and where feet get into close proximity and contact with the floor during the phases of human locomotion. We processed gait patterns recorded this way by extracting a feature vector containing the discretised distribution of occurring geometrical extents of significant sensor readings. This kind of feature vector is an implicit measure encoding the ratio of swing-to stance phase timings in the gait cycle and representing how cleanly the leg swing is performed. We then used the dataset to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron to perform regression with the age of the person as the target value, and the feature vector as input. With this method and a dataset size of 142 persons recorded, we achieved a mean absolute error of approximately 10 years between the true age and the estimated age of the person. Considering the novelty of our approach, this is an acceptable result. The combination of a floor sensor and machine learning methods for interpreting the sensor data seems promising for further research and applications in care and medicine.},

We report organ age profiles for 16 chronic diseases, where advanced biological aging extends from the organ of primary disease to multiple systems. Advanced body age associates with several lifestyle and environmental factors, leukocyte telomere lengths and mortality risk, and predicts survival time (area under the curve of 0.77) and premature death (area under the curve of 0.86).

Interventions to slow human aging will need to be applied to still-young individuals. However, most human aging research examines older adults, many with chronic disease. As a result, little is known about aging in young humans. We studied aging in 954 young humans, the Dunedin Study birth cohort, tracking multiple biomarkers across three time points spanning their third and fourth decades of life. We developed and validated two methods by which aging can be measured in young adults, one cross-sectional and one longitudinal. Our longitudinal measure allows quantification of the pace of coordinated physiological deterioration across multiple organ systems (e.g., pulmonary, periodontal, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and immune function). We applied these methods to assess biological aging in young humans who had not yet developed age-related diseases. Young individuals of the same chronological age varied in their ‚Äúbiological aging‚Äù (declining integrity of multiple organ systems). Already, before midlife, individuals who were aging more rapidly were less physically able, showed cognitive decline and brain aging, self-reported worse health, and looked older. Measured biological aging in young adults can be used to identify causes of aging and evaluate rejuvenation therapies.},

Repeated measurement design in a circadian study is prevalent, in which the same subject is repeatedly measured over time. Several methods are currently available to perform circadian analysis, however, none of them take advantage of the repeated measurement design. And ignoring the within-subject correlation from the repeated measurement could result in lower statistical power. To address this issue, we developed linear mixed model based methods to detect (i) circadian rhythmicity (i.e., Rpt\_rhythmicity) and (ii) differential circadian patterns comparing two experimental conditions (i.e., Rpt\_diff). Our model includes a subject-specific random effect, which will account for the within-subject correlation. Via simulations, we showed our method not only could control the type I error rate around the nominal level, but also achieve higher statistical power compared to other methods that cannot model repeated measurement. The superior performance of Rpt\_rhythmicity and Rpt\_diff were also demonstrated in two real data applications, including a human restricted feeding data and a human sleep restriction data. An R package for our methods is publicly available on GitHub to promote the application of our methods.},

Rhythmic expression of TNF in the draining lymph node enhances BMAL1-controlled ICAM-1 expression in high endothelial venules, resulting in lymphocyte infiltration and lymph node expansion. Lymph node cellularity continues to be different for weeks after the initial time-of-day-dependent challenge, which governs the immune response to vaccinations directed against Hepatitis A virus as well as SARS-CoV-2.

	abstract = {Brain structural morphology varies over the aging trajectory, and the prediction of a person‚Äôs age using brain morphological features can help the detection of an abnormal aging process. Neuroimaging-based brain age is widely used to quantify an individual‚Äôs brain health as deviation from a normative brain aging trajectory. Machine learning approaches are expanding the potential for accurate brain age prediction but are challenging due to the great variety of machine learning algorithms. Here, we aimed to compare the performance of the machine learning models used to estimate brain age using brain morphological measures derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. We evaluated 27 machine learning models, applied to three independent datasets from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, n = 1113, age range 22‚Äì37), the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN, n = 601, age range 18‚Äì88), and the Information eXtraction from Images (IXI, n = 567, age range 19‚Äì86). Performance was assessed within each sample using cross-validation and an unseen test set. The models achieved mean absolute errors of 2.75‚Äì3.12, 7.08‚Äì10.50, and 8.04‚Äì9.86 years, as well as Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficients of 0.11‚Äì0.42, 0.64‚Äì0.85, and 0.63‚Äì0.79 between predicted brain age and chronological age for the HCP, Cam-CAN, and IXI samples, respectively. We found a substantial difference in performance between models trained on the same data type, indicating that the choice of model yields considerable variation in brain-predicted age. Furthermore, in three datasets, regularized linear regression algorithms achieved similar performance to nonlinear and ensemble algorithms. Our results suggest that regularized linear algorithms are as effective as nonlinear and ensemble algorithms for brain age prediction, while significantly reducing computational costs. Our findings can serve as a starting point and quantitative reference for future efforts at improving brain age prediction using machine learning models applied to brain morphometric data.},

Promising developments consider multiple combinations of these various types of predictors, which may shed light on the aging process and provide further understanding of what contributes to healthy aging. Thus far, the most promising, new biological age predictor is the epigenetic clock; however its true value as a biomarker of aging requires longitudinal confirmation.},

	abstract = {Numerous aspects of mammalian physiology exhibit cyclic daily patterns, known as circadian rhythms. However, studies in aged humans and animals indicate that these physiological rhythms are not consistent throughout the life span. The simultaneous development of disrupted circadian rhythms and age-related impairments suggests a shared mechanism which may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Recently, the endocannabinoid system has emerged as a complex signaling network which regulates numerous aspects of circadian physiology relevant to the neurobiology of aging. Agonists of cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1) have consistently been shown to decrease neuronal activity, core body temperature, locomotion, and cognitive function. Paradoxically, several lines of evidence now suggest that very low doses of cannabinoids are beneficial in advanced age. One potential explanation for this phenomenon is that these drugs exhibit hormesis - a biphasic dose-response wherein low doses produce the opposite effects of higher doses. Therefore, it is important to determine the dose-, age-, and time-dependent effects of these substances on the regulation of circadian rhythms and other processes dysregulated in aging. This review highlights three fields - biological aging, circadian rhythms, and endocannabinoid signaling - to critically assess the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid modulation in aged individuals. If the hormetic properties of exogenous cannabinoids are confirmed, we conclude that precise administration of these compounds may bidirectionally entrain central and peripheral circadian clocks and benefit multiple aspects of aging physiology.},

Here, we show that gut microbe-targeted inhibition of the trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) pathway protects mice against the metabolic disturbances associated with diet-induced obesity (DIO) or leptin deficiency (Lepob/ob). Small molecule inhibition of the gut microbial enzyme choline TMA-lyase (CutC) does not reduce food intake but is instead associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, improvement in glucose tolerance, and enhanced energy expenditure. We also show that gut microbial CutC inhibition is associated with reorganization of host circadian control of both phosphatidylcholine and energy metabolism. This study underscores the relationship between microbe and host metabolism and provides evidence that gut microbe-derived trimethylamine (TMA) is a key regulator of the host circadian clock. This work also demonstrates that gut microbe-targeted enzyme inhibitors have potential as anti-obesity therapeutics.},

Adverse conditions can disturb the regularity and amplitude of circadian cycles, and, recently, there is interest in the field of chronobiology to quantify irregularities in the circadian rhythm as a means to track underlying pathologies. Alterations in physiological rhythms over a wide range of frequency scales may give additional information on health conditions but are often not considered in traditional analyses. Wavelets have been introduced to decompose physiological time series in components of different frequencies and can quantify irregular patterns, but the results may depend on the choice of the mother wavelet basis which is arbitrary. An alternative approach are recent data-adaptive time-series decomposition techniques, such as singular spectrum analysis (SSA), where the basis functions are generated by the data itself and are user-independent. In the present contribution, we compare wavelets and SSA analysis for the quantification of irregular rhythms at different frequency scales and discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages for application in chronobiology.},

While actigraphy monitoring suits the needs of home study, limited studies have examined mother and infant rhythm derived from actigraphy. Among this existing research a variety of analyses have been employed to characterize 24-h rhythm, reducing ability to evaluate and synthesize findings. Few studies have examined the correspondence of mother and infant circadian parameters for the most frequently cited approaches: cosinor, non-parametric circadian rhythm analysis (NPCRA), and autocorrelation function (ACF). The purpose of this research was to examine analytic approaches in the study of mother and infant circadian activity rhythm. Forty-three healthy mother and infant pairs were studied in the home environment over a 72h period at infant age 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Activity was recorded continuously using actigraphy monitors and mothers completed a diary. Parameters of circadian rhythm were generated from cosinor analysis, NPCRA, and ACF. The correlation among measures of rhythm center (cosinor mesor, NPCRA mid level), strength or fit of 24-h period (cosinor magnitude and R2, NPCRA amplitude and relative amplitude (RA)), phase (cosinor acrophase, NPCRA M10 and L5 midpoint), and rhythm stability and variability (NPCRA interdaily stability (IS) and intradaily variability (IV), ACF) was assessed, and additionally the effect size (eta2) for change over time evaluated. Results suggest that cosinor analysis, NPCRA, and autocorrelation provide several comparable parameters of infant and maternal circadian rhythm center, fit, and phase. IS and IV were strongly correlated with the 24-h cycle fit. The circadian parameters analyzed offer separate insight into rhythm and differing effect size for the detection of change over time. Findings inform selection of analysis and circadian parameters in the study of maternal and infant activity rhythm.},

	abstract = {Background
Although complex machine learning models are commonly outperforming the traditional simple interpretable models, clinicians find it hard to understand and trust these complex models due to the lack of intuition and explanation of their predictions. The aim of this study to demonstrate the utility of various model-agnostic explanation techniques of machine learning models with a case study for analyzing the outcomes of the machine learning random forest model for predicting the individuals at risk of developing hypertension based on cardiorespiratory fitness data.

Methods
The dataset used in this study contains information of 23,095 patients who underwent clinician-referred exercise treadmill stress testing at Henry Ford Health Systems between 1991 and 2009 and had a complete 10-year follow-up. Five global interpretability techniques (Feature Importance, Partial Dependence Plot, Individual Conditional Expectation, Feature Interaction, Global Surrogate Models) and two local interpretability techniques (Local Surrogate Models, Shapley Value) have been applied to present the role of the interpretability techniques on assisting the clinical staff to get better understanding and more trust of the outcomes of the machine learning-based predictions.

Results
Several experiments have been conducted and reported. The results show that different interpretability techniques can shed light on different insights on the model behavior where global interpretations can enable clinicians to understand the entire conditional distribution modeled by the trained response function. In contrast, local interpretations promote the understanding of small parts of the conditional distribution for specific instances.

Conclusions
Various interpretability techniques can vary in their explanations for the behavior of the machine learning model. The global interpretability techniques have the advantage that it can generalize over the entire population while local interpretability techniques focus on giving explanations at the level of instances. Both methods can be equally valid depending on the application need. Both methods are effective methods for assisting clinicians on the medical decision process, however, the clinicians will always remain to hold the final say on accepting or rejecting the outcome of the machine learning models and their explanations based on their domain expertise.},

	abstract = {Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) is a popular technique used to increase the interpretability and explainability of black box Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. LIME typically creates an explanation for a single prediction by any ML model by learning a simpler interpretable model (e.g., linear classifier) around the prediction through generating simulated data around the instance by random perturbation, and obtaining feature importance through applying some form of feature selection. While LIME and similar local algorithms have gained popularity due to their simplicity, the random perturbation methods result in shifts in data and instability in the generated explanations, where for the same prediction, different explanations can be generated. These are critical issues that can prevent deployment of LIME in sensitive domains. We propose a deterministic version of LIME. Instead of random perturbation, we utilize Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) to group the training data together and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) to select the relevant cluster of the new instance that is being explained. After finding the relevant cluster, a simple model (i.e., linear model or decision tree) is trained over the selected cluster to generate the explanations. Experimental results on six public (three binary and three multi-class) and six synthetic datasets show the superiority for Deterministic Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (DLIME), where we quantitatively determine the stability and faithfulness of DLIME compared to LIME.},

Through their ability to model complex nonlinear relationships, ML algorithms can often outperform traditional statistical prediction approaches, but the use of nonlinear functions can mean that ML techniques may also be less interpretable than traditional statistical methodologies. While there are benefits of intrinsic interpretability, many model-agnostic approaches now exist and can provide insight into the way in which ML systems make decisions.

Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model‚Äôs performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains.},

	abstract = {The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a profound impact on global health and economy, making it crucial to build accurate and interpretable data-driven predictive models for COVID-19 cases to improve public policy making. The extremely large scale of the pandemic and the intrinsically changing transmission characteristics pose a great challenge for effectively predicting COVID-19 cases. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid model in which the interpretability of the Autoregressive model (AR) and the predictive power of the long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM) join forces. The proposed hybrid model is formalized as a neural network with an architecture that connects two composing model blocks, of which the relative contribution is decided data-adaptively in the training procedure. We demonstrate the favorable performance of the hybrid model over its two single composing models as well as other popular predictive models through comprehensive numerical studies on two data sources under multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, in county-level data of 8 California counties, our hybrid model achieves 4.173\% MAPE, outperforming the composing AR (5.629\%) and LSTM (4.934\%) alone on average. In country-level datasets, our hybrid model outperforms the widely-used predictive models such as AR, LSTM, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest, in predicting the COVID-19 cases in Japan, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Singapore, Italy, and the United Kingdom. In addition to the predictive performance, we illustrate the interpretability of our proposed hybrid model using the estimated AR component, which is a key feature that is not shared by most black-box predictive models for COVID-19 cases. Our study provides a new and promising direction for building effective and interpretable data-driven models for COVID-19 cases, which could have significant implications for public health policy making and control of the current COVID-19 and potential future pandemics.},

	doi = {10.1038/s43856-022-00180-x},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unlike linear models which are traditionally used to study all-cause mortality, complex machine learning models can capture non-linear interrelations and provide opportunities to identify unexplored risk factors. Explainable artificial intelligence can improve prediction accuracy over linear models and reveal great insights into outcomes like mortality. This paper comprehensively analyzes all-cause mortality by explaining complex machine learning models.
METHODS: We propose the IMPACT framework that uses XAI technique to explain a state-of-the-art tree ensemble mortality prediction model. We apply IMPACT to understand all-cause mortality for 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year follow-up times within the NHANES dataset, which contains 47,261 samples and 151 features.
RESULTS: We show that IMPACT models achieve higher accuracy than linear models and neural networks. Using IMPACT, we identify several overlooked risk factors and interaction effects. Furthermore, we identify relationships between laboratory features and mortality that may suggest adjusting established reference intervals. Finally, we develop highly accurate, efficient and interpretable mortality risk scores that can be used by medical professionals and individuals without medical expertise. We ensure generalizability by performing temporal validation of the mortality risk scores and external validation of important findings with the UK Biobank dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: IMPACT's unique strength is the explainable prediction, which provides insights into the complex, non-linear relationships between mortality and features, while maintaining high accuracy. Our explainable risk scores could help individuals improve self-awareness of their health status and help clinicians identify patients with high risk. IMPACT takes a consequential step towards bringing contemporary developments in XAI to epidemiology.},

	abstract = {Background: Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic respiratory diseases. Despite increased investment in treatment, little progress has been made in the early recognition and treatment of asthma exacerbations over the last decade. Nocturnal cough monitoring may provide an opportunity to identify patients at risk for imminent exacerbations. Recently developed approaches enable smartphone-based cough monitoring. These approaches, however, have not undergone longitudinal overnight testing nor have they been specifically evaluated in the context of asthma. Also, the problem of distinguishing partner coughs from patient coughs when two or more people are sleeping in the same room using contact-free audio recordings remains unsolved.
Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the automatic recognition and segmentation of nocturnal asthmatic coughs and cough epochs in smartphone-based audio recordings that were collected in the field. We also aimed to distinguish partner coughs from patient coughs in contact-free audio recordings by classifying coughs based on sex.
Methods: We used a convolutional neural network model that we had developed in previous work for automated cough recognition. We further used techniques (such as ensemble learning, minibatch balancing, and thresholding) to address the imbalance in the data set. We evaluated the classifier in a classification task and a segmentation task. The cough-recognition classifier served as the basis for the cough-segmentation classifier from continuous audio recordings. We compared automated cough and cough-epoch counts to human-annotated cough and cough-epoch counts. We employed Gaussian mixture models to build a classifier for cough and cough-epoch signals based on sex.
Results: We recorded audio data from 94 adults with asthma (overall: mean 43 years; SD 16 years; female: 54/94, 57\%; male 40/94, 43\%). Audio data were recorded by each participant in their everyday environment using a smartphone placed next to their bed; recordings were made over a period of 28 nights. Out of 704,697 sounds, we identified 30,304 sounds as coughs. A total of 26,166 coughs occurred without a 2-second pause between coughs, yielding 8238 cough epochs. The ensemble classifier performed well with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 92\% in a pure classification task and achieved comparable cough counts to that of human annotators in the segmentation of coughing. The count difference between automated and human-annotated coughs was a mean ‚Äì0.1 (95\% CI ‚Äì12.11, 11.91) coughs. The count difference between automated and human-annotated cough epochs was a mean 0.24 (95\% CI ‚Äì3.67, 4.15) cough epochs. The Gaussian mixture model cough epoch‚Äìbased sex classification performed best yielding an accuracy of 83\%.
Conclusions: Our study showed longitudinal nocturnal cough and cough-epoch recognition from nightly recorded smartphone-based audio from adults with asthma. The model distinguishes partner cough from patient cough in contact-free recordings by identifying cough and cough-epoch signals that correspond to the sex of the patient. This research represents a step towards enabling passive and scalable cough monitoring for adults with asthma.},

	abstract = {Introduction Heart Failure (HF) is a major health and economic issue worldwide. HF-related expenses are largely driven by hospital admissions and re-admissions, many of which are potentially preventable. Current self-management programs, however, have failed to reduce hospital admissions. This may be explained by their low predictive power for decompensation and high adherence requirements. Slight alterations in the voice profile may allow to detect decompensation in HF patients at an earlier stage and reduce hospitalizations. This pilot study investigates the potential of voice as a digital biomarker to predict health status deterioration in HF patients. Methods and analysis In a two-month longitudinal observational study, we collect voice samples and HF-related quality-of-life questionnaires from 35 stable HF patients. Patients use our developed study application installed on a tablet at home during the study period. From the collected data, we use signal processing to extract voice characteristics from the audio samples and associate them with the answers to the questionnaire data. The primary outcome will be the correlation between voice characteristics and HF-related quality-of-life health status. Ethics and dissemination The study was reviewed and approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee Zurich (BASEC ID:2022-00912). Results will be published in medical and technical peer-reviewed journals.},

	abstract = {Background: Clinical deterioration can go unnoticed in hospital wards for hours. Mobile technologies such as wearables and smartphones enable automated, continuous, noninvasive ward monitoring and allow the detection of subtle changes in vital signs. Cough can be effectively monitored through mobile technologies in the ward, as it is not only a symptom of prevalent respiratory diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, and COVID-19 but also a predictor of acute health deterioration. In past decades, many efforts have been made to develop an automatic cough counting tool. To date, however, there is neither a standardized, sufficiently validated method nor a scalable cough monitor that can be deployed on a consumer-centric device that reports cough counts continuously. These shortcomings limit the tracking of coughing and, consequently, hinder the monitoring of disease progression in prevalent respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and COVID-19 in the ward.
Objective: This exploratory study involved the validation of an automated smartphone-based monitoring system for continuous cough counting in 2 different modes in the ward. Unlike previous studies that focused on evaluating cough detection models on unseen data, the focus of this work is to validate a holistic smartphone-based cough detection system operating in near real time.
Methods: Automated cough counts were measured consistently on devices and on computers and compared with cough and noncough sounds counted manually over 8-hour long nocturnal recordings in 9 patients with pneumonia in the ward. The proposed cough detection system consists primarily of an Android app running on a smartphone that detects coughs and records sounds and secondarily of a backend that continuously receives the cough detection information and displays the hourly cough counts. Cough detection is based on an ensemble convolutional neural network developed and trained on asthmatic cough data.
Results: In this validation study, a total of 72 hours of recordings from 9 participants with pneumonia, 4 of whom were infected with SARS-CoV-2, were analyzed. All the recordings were subjected to manual analysis by 2 blinded raters. The proposed system yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 72\% and 99\% on the device and 82\% and 99\% on the computer, respectively, for detecting coughs. The mean differences between the automated and human rater cough counts were ‚àí1.0 (95\% CI ‚àí12.3 to 10.2) and ‚àí0.9 (95\% CI ‚àí6.5 to 4.8) coughs per hour within subject for the on-device and on-computer modes, respectively.
Conclusions: The proposed system thus represents a smartphone cough counter that can be used for continuous hourly assessment of cough frequency in the ward.},

	abstract = {Elucidating the complex degradation pathways and formed decomposition products of the electrolytes in Li-metal batteries remains challenging. So far, computational studies have been dominated by studying the reactions at inert Li-metal surfaces. In contrast, this study combines DFT and AIMD calculations to explore the Li-nucleation process for studying interfacial reactions during Li-plating by introducing Li-atoms close to the metal surface. These Li-atoms were added into the PEO polymer electrolytes in three stages to simulate the spontaneous reactions. It is found that the highly reactive Li-atoms added during the simulated nucleation contribute to PEO decomposition, and the resulting SEI components in this calculation include lithium alkoxide, ethylene, and lithium ethylene complexes. Meanwhile, the analysis of atomic charge provides a reliable guideline for XPS spectrum fitting in these complicated multicomponent systems. This work gives new insights into the Li-nucleation process, and experimental XPS data supporting this computational strategy. The AIMD/DFT approach combined with surface XPS spectra can thus help efficiently screen potential polymer materials for solid-state battery polymer electrolytes.},

Nonetheless, such tools are underdeveloped in the context of COVID-19. In the present article we asked whether accurate prognostic scales could be developed to optimize the use of hospital resources. We retrospectively studied 467 files of hospitalized patients after COVID-19. The odds ratios for 16 different biomarkers were calculated, those that were significantly associated were screened by a Pearson‚Äôs correlation, and such index was used to establish the mathematical function for each marker. The scales to predict the need for hospitalization, intensive-care requirement and mortality had enhanced sensitivities (0.91 CI 0.87‚Äì0.94; 0.96 CI 0.94‚Äì0.98; 0.96 CI 0.94‚Äì0.98; all with p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.0001) and specificities (0.74 CI 0.62‚Äì0.83; 0.92 CI 0.87‚Äì0.96 and 0.91 CI 0.86‚Äì0.94; all with p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.0001). Interestingly, when a different population was assayed, these parameters did not change considerably. These results show a novel approach to establish the mathematical function of a marker in the development of highly sensitive prognostic tools, which in this case, may aid in the optimization of hospital resources.

Early clinical prediction is typically based on manually calculated screening metrics that simply weigh these parameters, such as early warning scores (EWS). The predictive performance of EWSs yields a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity that can lead to negative outcomes for the patient. Previous work on electronic health records (EHR) trained artificial intelligence (AI) systems offers promising results with high levels of predictive performance in relation to the early, real-time prediction of acute critical illness. However, without insight into the complex decisions by such system, clinical translation is hindered. Here, we present an explainable AI early warning score (xAI-EWS) system for early detection of acute critical illness. xAI-EWS potentiates clinical translation by accompanying a prediction with information on the EHR data explaining it.},

	abstract = {While stroke is one of the leading causes of disability, the prediction of upper limb (UL) functional recovery following rehabilitation is still unsatisfactory, hampered by the clinical complexity of post-stroke impairment. Predictive models leading to accurate estimates while revealing which features contribute most to the predictions are the key to unveil the mechanisms subserving the post-intervention recovery, prompting a new focus on individualized treatments and precision medicine in stroke. Machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are emerging as the enabling technology in different fields, being promising tools also in clinics. In this study, we had the twofold goal of evaluating whether ML can allow deriving accurate predictions of UL recovery in sub-acute patients, and disentangling the contribution of the variables shaping the outcomes. To do so, Random Forest equipped with four XAI methods was applied to interpret the results and assess the feature relevance and their consensus. Our results revealed increased performance when using ML compared to conventional statistical approaches. Moreover, the features deemed as the most relevant were concordant across the XAI methods, suggesting good stability of the results. In particular, the baseline motor impairment as measured by simple clinical scales had the largest impact, as expected. Our findings highlight the core role of ML not only for accurately predicting the individual outcome scores after rehabilitation, but also for making ML results interpretable when associated to XAI methods. This provides clinicians with robust predictions and reliable explanations that are key factors in therapeutic planning/monitoring of stroke patients.},

	abstract = {Background In older adults, circadian rhythms show alterations in multiple dimensions with aging and during Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia progression. We propose that circadian function may serve as a unique gauge of biological age (i.e., circadian age), and that individuals with greater circadian age than chronological age have increased risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia. Method We constructed a regression model with chronological age as the predicting target. The model prediction was termed circadian age. A softplus activation function was used to ensure positivity. The model was optimized to minimize the mean-squared prediction error while penalizing the covariance between chronological age and prediction error. Cosinor analysis, nonparametric analysis, uniform phase empirical mode decomposition, and detrended fluctuation analysis were performed on baseline actigraphy data of 882 participants (age: 80.1¬±7.3; female/male: 692/190) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project who were cognitively intact and were not taking sleep medications. These analyses resulted in 23 features for circadian daily activity patterns as model inputs. The optimal model was trained through cross-validation for the penalization parameter and applied to follow-up actigraphy data. We compared circadian age among participants at different cognitive stages, evaluated the longitudinal change of circadian age, and examined the association of circadian age with incident Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia. Result Chronological age explained 24.8\% of the variance in circadian age. At analytical baseline, participants with Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia had significantly greater circadian‚Äìchronological age deviation (CCD) than cognitively normal participants (2.98¬±1.43 vs. -0.13¬±0.42 years, p=0.04). For each 1-year increase in chronological age, circadian age increased by 1.05¬±0.06 years (p{\textless}0.001), suggesting accelerated circadian aging. Among baseline cognitively normal participants, greater CCD was associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia independent from chronological age, sex, total daily activity, sleep fragmentation, vascular disease and risk factors, and depressive symptoms. For a 10-year increase in CCD, the hazard ratio was 1.23 (95\% CI: 1.06-1.42). Conclusion Circadian daily patterns can be integrated to predict chronological age. Older circadian age than chronological age is an independent risk factor for Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia. Future work should refine the determination of health status for training dataset and examine whether circadian age links with endogenous circadian function.},

The machine learning algorithm extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) achieved a mean absolute error of 2 years in predicting the age of new subjects. Feature importance analysis showed that the brain-to-intracranial-volume ratio is the most important feature in predicting age, followed by the hippocampi volumes.

OBJECTIVE: We performed an evaluation of HRV collected by a wearable device to identify and predict COVID-19 and its related symptoms.
METHODS: Health care workers in the Mount Sinai Health System were prospectively followed in an ongoing observational study using the custom Warrior Watch Study app, which was downloaded to their smartphones. Participants wore an Apple Watch for the duration of the study, measuring HRV throughout the follow-up period. Surveys assessing infection and symptom-related questions were obtained daily.
RESULTS: Using a mixed-effect cosinor model, the mean amplitude of the circadian pattern of the standard deviation of the interbeat interval of normal sinus beats (SDNN), an HRV metric, differed between subjects with and without COVID-19 (P=.006). The mean amplitude of this circadian pattern differed between individuals during the 7 days before and the 7 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis compared to this metric during uninfected time periods (P=.01). Significant changes in the mean and amplitude of the circadian pattern of the SDNN was observed between the first day of reporting a COVID-19-related symptom compared to all other symptom-free days (P=.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinally collected HRV metrics from a commonly worn commercial wearable device (Apple Watch) can predict the diagnosis of COVID-19 and identify COVID-19-related symptoms.

Early clinical prediction is typically based on manually calculated screening metrics that simply weigh these parameters, such as early warning scores (EWS). The predictive performance of EWSs yields a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity that can lead to negative outcomes for the patient. Previous work on electronic health records (EHR) trained artificial intelligence (AI) systems offers promising results with high levels of predictive performance in relation to the early, real-time prediction of acute critical illness. However, without insight into the complex decisions by such system, clinical translation is hindered. Here, we present an explainable AI early warning score (xAI-EWS) system for early detection of acute critical illness. xAI-EWS potentiates clinical translation by accompanying a prediction with information on the EHR data explaining it.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives:
Chronotype, or diurnal preference, refers to behavioral manifestations of the endogenous circadian system that governs preferred timing of sleep and wake. As variations in circadian timing and system perturbations are linked to disease development, the fundamental biology of chronotype has received attention for its role in the regulation and dysregulation of sleep and related illnesses. Family studies indicate that chronotype is a heritable trait, thus directing attention toward its genetic basis. Although discoveries from molecular studies of candidate genes have shed light onto its genetic architecture, the contribution of genetic variation to chronotype has remained unclear with few related variants identified. In the advent of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), scientists now have the ability to discover novel common genetic variants associated with complex phenotypes. Three recent large-scale GWASs of chronotype were conducted on subjects of European ancestry from the 23andMe cohort and the UK Biobank. This review discusses the findings of these landmark GWASs in the context of prior research.

Methods:
We systematically reviewed and compared methodological and analytical approaches and results across the three GWASs of chronotype.

Results:
A good deal of consistency was observed across studies with 9 genes identified in 2 of the 3 GWASs. Several genes previously unknown to influence chronotype were identified.

Conclusions:
GWAS is an important tool in identifying common variants associated with the complex chronotype phenotype, the findings of which can supplement and guide molecular science. Future directions in model systems and discovery of rare variants are discussed.},

For circadian assessment, one hour after turning the light on (ZT1), animals were sacrificed every 6 h (ZT1, ZT7, ZT13 and ZT19). Interestingly, GSPE was able to restore the rhythm on clock hepatic genes (Bmal1, Per2, Cry1, RorŒ±), as this correction was more evident in nocturnal treatment. Additionally, during nocturnal treatment, an increase in hepatic fusion genes and a decrease in fission genes were observed. Regarding mitochondrial complex activity, there was a strong effect of cafeteria diet at nearly all ZTs, and GSPE was able to restore activity at discrete ZTs, mainly in the diurnal treatment (ZT0). Furthermore, a differential behavior was observed in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolites between GSPE diurnal and nocturnal administration times.

In healthy adults, sleep restriction without circadian misalignment promotes insulin resistance. To determine whether the misalignment of circadian rhythms that typically occurs in shift work involves intrinsic adverse metabolic effects independently of sleep loss, a parallel group design was used to study 26 healthy adults. Both interventions involved 3 inpatient days with 10-h bedtimes, followed by 8 inpatient days of sleep restriction to 5 h with fixed nocturnal bedtimes (circadian alignment) or with bedtimes delayed by 8.5 h on 4 of the 8 days (circadian misalignment). Daily total sleep time (SD) during the intervention was nearly identical in the aligned and misaligned conditions (4 h 48 min [5 min] vs. 4 h 45 min [6 min]). In both groups, insulin sensitivity (SI) significantly decreased after sleep restriction, without a compensatory increase in insulin secretion, and inflammation increased. In male participants exposed to circadian misalignment, the reduction in SI and the increase in inflammation both doubled compared with those who maintained regular nocturnal bedtimes. Circadian misalignment that occurs in shift work may increase diabetes risk and inflammation, independently of sleep loss.},

	abstract = {To convert accelerometer-based devices onto the same scale, a platform called Monitor-Independent Movement Summary (MIMS) was created and used in national studies. Yet, its physical activity (PA) intensity cutoff scores have not been established, making it less useful. This study was to link MIMS with the ActiGraph Count, known as ‚Äúthe Count,‚Äù using the test-equating method. A total of 81 obese participants aged 10‚Äì17 years old (male = 56\%) were recruited to perform one-minute warm-ups and walking or running at different speeds with ActiGraph on hips. Data with corresponding Count and MIMS were split into training (n = 65, male = 54\%) and testing samples (n = 16, male = 63\%). Linear and equipercentile equating were applied to the training sample to equate MIMS onto Count, creating MIMS-equated Count (MIMS-EQ-Count), a new MIMS-based unit. High correlation (‚â•.84), high agreements ({\textgreater}.7) and kappas (mostly {\textgreater}.5) between MIMS-EQ-Count and the Count in both training and testing samples under both linear and equipercentile methods. Equipercentile was the best equating method because of smaller standard errors. Yielded from equipercentile equating, a table linking MIMS and MIMS-EQ-Count was constructed, from which MIMS was linked and cross-validated with the well-studied Count. MIMS can now use the rich information accumulated for the Count of ActiGraph.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To compare the degree to which four accelerometer metrics‚Äîtotal activity counts per day (TAC/d), steps per day (steps/d), physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE, kcal/kg/day), and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA, min/d)‚Äî were correlated with PAEE measured by doubly-labeled water (DLW). Additionally, accelerometer metrics based on vertical axis counts and triaxial counts were compared.

Methods
This analysis included 684 women and 611 men aged 43 ‚Äì 83 years. Participants wore the Actigraph GT3X on the hip for seven days twice during the study and the average of the two measurements was used. Each participant also completed one DLW measurement, with a subset having a repeat. PAEE was estimated by subtracting resting metabolic rate and the thermic effect of food from total daily energy expenditure estimated by DLW. Partial Spearman correlations were used to estimate associations between PAEE and each accelerometer metric.

Results
Correlations between the accelerometer metrics and DLW-determined PAEE were higher for triaxial counts than vertical axis counts. After adjusting for weight, age, accelerometer wear time, and fat free mass, the correlation between TAC/d based on triaxial counts and DLW-determined PAEE was 0.44 in women and 0.41 in men. Correlations for steps/d and accelerometer-estimated PAEE with DLW-determined PAEE were similar. After adjustment for within-person variation in DLW-determined PAEE, the correlations for TAC/d increased to 0.61 and 0.49, respectively. Correlations between MVPA and DLW-determined PAEE were lower, particularly for modified bouts of ‚â•10 minutes.

Conclusion
Accelerometer measures that represent total activity volume, including TAC/d, steps/d, and PAEE, were more highly correlated with DLW-determined PAEE than MVPA using traditional thresholds and should be considered by researchers seeking to reduce accelerometer data to a single metric.},

The metabolic syndrome has direct effects on health and increases the risk of developing cancer. Lifestyle factors that are known to promote the metabolic syndrome generally cause pro-inflammatory alterations in microbiota communities in the intestine. Indeed, alterations to the structure and function of intestinal microbiota are sufficient to promote the metabolic syndrome, inflammation and cancer. Among the lifestyle factors that are associated with the metabolic syndrome, disruption of the circadian system, known as circadian dysrhythmia, is increasingly common. Disruption of the circadian system can alter microbiome communities and can perturb host metabolism, energy homeostasis and inflammatory pathways, which leads to the metabolic syndrome. This Perspective discusses the role of intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites in mediating the effects of disruption of circadian rhythms on human health.},

Currently, saliva testing is used for clinical assessment of hormonal perturbations, detection of HIV antibodies, DNA analysis, alcohol screening, and drug testing. Recently, there has been increasing interest in evaluating the diagnostic potential of saliva in obesity, inflammation, and insulin-resistance. Current literature has demonstrated elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers including C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-Œ±, interleukin-6, and interferon-Œ≥ in saliva of obese/overweight children and adults. Salivary antioxidant status has also been studied as a measure of oxidative stress in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Further, several studies have demonstrated correlations of salivary markers of stress and insulin resistance including cortisol, insulin, adiponectin, and resistin with serum concentrations. These findings suggest the potential diagnostic value of saliva in health screening and risk stratification studies, particularly in the pediatric population, with implications for inflammatory, metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. However, additional studies are required to standardize saliva collection and storage procedures, validate analytical techniques for biomarker detection, and establish reference ranges for routine clinical use. The purpose of this review is to summarize and evaluate recent advancements in using saliva as a diagnostic tool for inflammation and insulin-resistance.},

	abstract = {C-reactive protein (CRP), a humoral component of the innate immune system with important functions in host-defense, is extensively used as a sensitive biomarker of systemic inflammation. During inflammation, hepatocyte-derived CRP rises dramatically in the blood due to increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Reliable detection of CRP in saliva, instead of blood, would offer advantages regarding sampling procedure and availability but using saliva as a diagnostic body fluid comes with challenges. The aims of this study were to evaluate associations between salivary CRP, total protein levels in saliva and serum CRP. Furthermore, we examined associations with plasma IL-6, body mass index (BMI), tobacco smoking and age. Salivary CRP was investigated by ELISA in 107 middle-aged participants from the general population. We employed spectrophotometric determination of total protein levels. Correlation analyses were used for associations of salivary CRP with serum CRP (turbidimetry), plasma IL-6 (Luminex¬Æ), BMI and smoking habits. Salivary median CRP was 68\% higher (p=0.009), and total protein levels were 167\% higher (p{\textless}0.0001), in morning compared to evening saliva. The correlation coefficients between serum and salivary CRP were low to moderate, but stronger for evening than morning saliva. Plasma IL-6 correlated significantly with serum CRP (rs=0.41, p{\textless}0.01), but not with morning or evening salivary CRP. Non-smokers showed 103\% higher salivary CRP levels (p=0.015), whereas serum CRP was independent of smoking status. As opposed to CRP in serum, salivary CRP was not associated with BMI. Salivary CRP was 90\% higher among the age interval 60‚Äì69 years compared to subjects aged 45‚Äì59 (p=0.02) while serum CRP levels did not differ between the age groups. In conclusion, CRP in saliva did not straightforwardly reflect serum concentrations. This raises questions regarding adequate reflection of biological events. The pronounced diurnal salivary CRP pattern accentuates the importance of standardizing the time-point of sampling.},

	abstract = {Background: Data collected by an actigraphy device worn on the wrist or waist can provide objective measurements for studies related to physical activity; however, some data may contain intervals where values are missing. In previous studies, statistical methods have been applied to impute missing values on the basis of statistical assumptions. Deep learning algorithms, however, can learn features from the data without any such assumptions and may outperform previous approaches in imputation tasks.
Objective: The aim of this study was to impute missing values in data using a deep learning approach.
Methods: To develop an imputation model for missing values in accelerometer-based actigraphy data, a denoising convolutional autoencoder was adopted. We trained and tested our deep learning‚Äìbased imputation model with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data set and validated it with the external Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the Korean Chronic Cerebrovascular Disease Oriented Biobank data sets which consist of daily records measuring activity counts. The partial root mean square error and partial mean absolute error of the imputed intervals (partial RMSE and partial MAE, respectively) were calculated using our deep learning‚Äìbased imputation model (zero-inflated denoising convolutional autoencoder) as well as using other approaches (mean imputation, zero-inflated Poisson regression, and Bayesian regression).
Results: The zero-inflated denoising convolutional autoencoder exhibited a partial RMSE of 839.3 counts and partial MAE of 431.1 counts, whereas mean imputation achieved a partial RMSE of 1053.2 counts and partial MAE of 545.4 counts, the zero-inflated Poisson regression model achieved a partial RMSE of 1255.6 counts and partial MAE of 508.6 counts, and Bayesian regression achieved a partial RMSE of 924.5 counts and partial MAE of 605.8 counts.
Conclusions: Our deep learning‚Äìbased imputation model performed better than the other methods when imputing missing values in actigraphy data.},

Epoch-level correlation coefficients (r) were ‚â•0.73, and weighted kappa for intensity classifications ranged from 0.71 (ENMO, hip) to 0.98 (VM counts, non-dominant wrist). Monitors were equivalent for all outcomes, except ENMO (all locations/monitors), percent of time spent in sedentary/light (hip) and moderate (hip and non-dominant wrist) activity as classified by ENMO-based cut-points, and vigorous activity as classified by VM count cut-points (non-dominant wrist; p {\textgreater}¬†0.05). While epoch-level data were not identical, most outcomes were strongly related between models (e.g., MAD, VM) and equivalent once reduced to percent of time spent in each intensity. However, monitor output was not equivalent for the acceleration-based metric ENMO, suggesting that caution should be exercised when comparing this outcome among ActiGraph models.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2458-14-1210},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accelerometers objectively assess physical activity (PA) and are currently used in several large-scale epidemiological studies, but there is no consensus for processing the data. This study compared the impact of wear-time assessment methods and using either vertical (V)-axis or vector magnitude (VM) cut-points on accelerometer output.
METHODS: Participants (7,650 women, mean age 71.4 y) were mailed an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+), instructed to wear it for 7 days, record dates and times the monitor was worn on a log, and return the monitor and log via mail. Data were processed using three wear-time methods (logs, Troiano or Choi algorithms) and V-axis or VM cut-points.
RESULTS: Using algorithms alone resulted in "mail-days" incorrectly identified as "wear-days" (27-79\% of subjects had {\textgreater}7-days of valid data). Using only dates from the log and the Choi algorithm yielded: 1) larger samples with valid data than using log dates and times, 2) similar wear-times as using log dates and times, 3) more wear-time (V, 48.1 min more; VM, 29.5 min more) than only log dates and Troiano algorithm. Wear-time algorithm impacted sedentary time ({\textasciitilde}30-60 min lower for Troiano vs. Choi) but not moderate-to-vigorous (MV) PA time. Using V-axis cut-points yielded {\textasciitilde}60 min more sedentary time and {\textasciitilde}10 min less MVPA time than using VM cut-points.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining log-dates and the Choi algorithm was optimal, minimizing missing data and researcher burden. Estimates of time in physical activity and sedentary behavior are not directly comparable between V-axis and VM cut-points. These findings will inform consensus development for accelerometer data processing in ongoing epidemiologic studies.},

	abstract = {Accelerometers objectively monitor physical activity, and ongoing research suggests they can also detect patterns of body movement. However, different types of signal (uniaxial, captured by older studies, vs. the newer triaxial) and or/device (validated Actigraph used by older studies, vs. others) may lead to incomparability of results from different time periods. Standardization is desirable. We establish whether uniaxial signals adequately monitor routine activity, and whether triaxial accelerometry can detect sport-specific variations in movement pattern. 1402 adolescents wore triaxial Actigraphs (GT3X) for one week and diaried sport. Uni- and triaxial counts per minute were compared across the week and between over 30 different sports. Across the whole recording period 95\% of variance in triaxial counts was explained by the vertical axis (5th percentile for R2, 91\%). Sport made up a small fraction of daily routine, but differences were visible: even when total acceleration was comparable, little was vertical in horizontal movements, such as ice skating (uniaxial counts 41\% of triaxial) compared to complex movements (taekwondo, 55\%) or ambulation (soccer, 69\%). Triaxial accelerometry captured differences in movement pattern between sports, but so little time was spent in sport that, across the whole day, uni- and triaxial signals correlated closely. This indicates that, with certain limitations, uniaxial accelerometric measures of routine activity from older studies can be feasibly compared to triaxial measures from newer studies. Comparison of new studies based on raw accelerations to older studies based on proprietary devices and measures (epochs, counts) will require additional efforts which are not addressed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Background Higher levels of physical activity (PA) are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, uncertainty exists on whether the inverse relationship between PA and incidence of CVD is greater at the highest levels of PA. Past studies have mostly relied on self-reported evidence from questionnaire-based PA, which is crude and cannot capture all PA undertaken. We investigated the association between accelerometer-measured moderate, vigorous, and total PA and incident CVD. Methods and findings We obtained accelerometer-measured moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity physical activities and total volume of PA, over a 7-day period in 2013‚Äì2015, for 90,211 participants without prior or concurrent CVD in the UK Biobank cohort. Participants in the lowest category of total PA smoked more, had higher body mass index and C-reactive protein, and were diagnosed with hypertension. PA was associated with 3,617 incident CVD cases during 440,004 person-years of follow-up (median (interquartile range [IQR]): 5.2 (1.2) years) using Cox regression models. We found a linear dose‚Äìresponse relationship for PA, whether measured as moderate-intensity, vigorous-intensity, or as total volume, with risk of incident of CVD. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals for increasing quarters of the PA distribution relative to the lowest fourth were for moderate-intensity PA: 0.71 (0.65, 0.77), 0.59 (0.54, 0.65), and 0.46 (0.41, 0.51); for vigorous-intensity PA: 0.70 (0.64, 0.77), 0.54 (0.49,0.59), and 0.41 (0.37,0.46); and for total volume of PA: 0.73 (0.67, 0.79), 0.63 (0.57, 0.69), and 0.47 (0.43, 0.52). We took account of potential confounders but unmeasured confounding remains a possibility, and while removal of early deaths did not affect the estimated HRs, we cannot completely dismiss the likelihood that reverse causality has contributed to the findings. Another possible limitation of this work is the quantification of PA intensity-levels based on methods validated in relatively small studies. Conclusions In this study, we found no evidence of a threshold for the inverse association between objectively measured moderate, vigorous, and total PA with CVD. Our findings suggest that PA is not only associated with lower risk for of CVD, but the greatest benefit is seen for those who are active at the highest level.},

Using data from simple wrist-worn activity monitors, we developed a tailored machine learning model, using balanced random forests with Hidden Markov Models, to reliably detect a number of activity modes. We show that physical activity and sleep behaviours can be classified with 87\% accuracy in 159,504‚Äâminutes of recorded free-living behaviours from 132 adults. These trained models can be used to infer fine resolution activity patterns at the population scale in 96,220 participants. For example, we find that men spend more time in both low- and high- intensity behaviours, while women spend more time in mixed behaviours. Walking time is highest in spring and sleep time lowest during the summer.

	abstract = {Objective To improve classification of movement behaviours in free-living accelerometer data using machine-learning methods, and to investigate the association between machine-learned movement behaviours and risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults.
Methods Using free-living data from 152 participants, we developed a machine-learning model to classify movement behaviours (moderate-to-vigorous physical activity behaviours (MVPA), light physical activity behaviours, sedentary behaviour, sleep) in wrist-worn accelerometer data. Participants in UK Biobank, a prospective cohort, were asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 days, and we applied our machine-learning model to classify their movement behaviours. Using compositional data analysis Cox regression, we investigated how reallocating time between movement behaviours was associated with CVD incidence.
Results In leave-one-participant-out analysis, our machine-learning method classified free-living movement behaviours with mean accuracy 88\% (95\% CI 87\% to 89\%) and Cohen‚Äôs kappa 0.80 (95\% CI 0.79 to 0.82). Among 87 498 UK Biobank participants, there were 4105 incident CVD events. Reallocating time from any behaviour to MVPA, or reallocating time from sedentary behaviour to any behaviour, was associated with lower CVD risk. For an average individual, reallocating 20 min/day to MVPA from all other behaviours proportionally was associated with 9\% (95\% CI 7\% to 10\%) lower risk, while reallocating 1 hour/day to sedentary behaviour from all other behaviours proportionally was associated with 5\% (95\% CI 3\% to 7\%) higher risk.
Conclusion Machine-learning methods classified movement behaviours accurately in free-living accelerometer data. Reallocating time from other behaviours to MVPA, and from sedentary behaviour to other behaviours, was associated with lower risk of incident CVD, and should be promoted by interventions and guidelines.},

	abstract = {Physical activity and sleep duration are established risk factors for many diseases, but their aetiology is poorly understood, partly due to relying on self-reported evidence. Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of device-measured physical activity and sleep duration in 91,105 UK Biobank participants, finding 14 significant loci (7 novel). These loci account for 0.06\% of activity and 0.39\% of sleep duration variation. Genome-wide estimates of {\textasciitilde}‚Äâ15\% phenotypic variation indicate high polygenicity. Heritability is higher in women than men for overall activity (23 vs. 20\%, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.5‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí4) and sedentary behaviours (18 vs. 15\%, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ9.7‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí4). Heritability partitioning, enrichment and pathway analyses indicate the central nervous system plays a role in activity behaviours. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation suggests that increased activity might causally lower diastolic blood pressure (beta mmHg/SD: ‚àí0.91, SE‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.18, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ8.2‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí7), and odds of hypertension (Odds ratio/SD: 0.84, SE‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.03, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ4.9‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí8). Our results advocate the value of physical activity for reducing blood pressure.},

Using accelerometer data from 85,670 UK Biobank participants, we perform a genome-wide association study of 8 derived sleep traits representing sleep quality, quantity and timing, and validate our findings in 5,819 individuals.

These include 26 novel associations with measures of sleep quality and 10 with nocturnal sleep duration. The majority of identified variants associate with a single sleep trait, except for variants previously associated with restless legs syndrome. For sleep duration we identify a missense variant (p.Tyr727Cys) in PDE11A as the likely causal variant. As a group, sleep quality loci are enriched for serotonin processing genes. Although accelerometer-derived measures of sleep are imperfect and may be affected by restless legs syndrome, these findings provide new biological insights into sleep compared to previous efforts based on self-report sleep measures.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are crucial for regulating physiological and behavioral processes. Pineal hormone melatonin is often used to measure circadian amplitude but its collection is costly and time-consuming. Wearable activity data are promising alternative, but the most commonly used measure, relative amplitude, is subject to behavioral masking. In this study, we firstly derive a feature named circadian activity rhythm energy (CARE) to better characterize circadian amplitude and validate CARE by correlating it with melatonin amplitude (Pearson‚Äôs r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.46, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.007) among 33 healthy participants. Then we investigate its association with cognitive functions in an adolescent dataset (Chinese SCHEDULE-A, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1703) and an adult dataset (UK Biobank, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ92,202), and find that CARE is significantly associated with Global Executive Composite (Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ30.86, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.016) in adolescents, and reasoning ability, short-term memory, and prospective memory (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01, 3.42, and 11.47 respectively, all P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001) in adults. Finally, we identify one genetic locus with 126 CARE-associated SNPs using the genome-wide association study, of which 109 variants are used as instrumental variables in the Mendelian Randomization analysis, and the results show a significant causal effect of CARE on reasoning ability, short-term memory, and prospective memory (Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ-59.91, 7.94, and 16.85 respectively, all P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.0001). The present study suggests that CARE is an effective wearable-based metric of circadian amplitude with a strong genetic basis and clinical significance, and its adoption can facilitate future circadian studies and potential intervention strategies to improve circadian rhythms and cognitive functions.},

	abstract = {Background: Compared with adults with normal glucose metabolism, those with prediabetes tend to be frail. However, it remains poorly understood whether frailty could identify adults who are most at risk of adverse outcomes related to prediabetes.
Objective: We aimed to systematically evaluate the associations between frailty, a simple health indicator, and risks of multiple adverse outcomes including incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), diabetes-related microvascular disease, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), eye disease, dementia, depression, and all-cause mortality in late life among middle-aged adults with prediabetes.
Methods: We evaluated 38,950 adults aged 40 years to 64 years with prediabetes using the baseline survey from the UK Biobank. Frailty was assessed using the frailty phenotype (FP; range 0-5), and participants were grouped into nonfrail (FP=0), prefrail (1‚â§FP‚â§2), and frail (FP‚â•3). Multiple adverse outcomes (ie, T2DM, diabetes-related microvascular disease, CVD, CKD, eye disease, dementia, depression, and all-cause mortality) were ascertained during a median follow-up of 12 years. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the associations. Several sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results.
Results: At baseline, 49.1\% (19,122/38,950) and 5.9\% (2289/38,950) of adults with prediabetes were identified as prefrail and frail, respectively. Both prefrailty and frailty were associated with higher risks of multiple adverse outcomes in adults with prediabetes (P for trend \&lt;.001). For instance, compared with their nonfrail counterparts, frail participants with prediabetes had a significantly higher risk (P\&lt;.001) of T2DM (hazard ratio [HR]=1.73, 95\% CI 1.55-1.92), diabetes-related microvascular disease (HR=1.89, 95\% CI 1.64-2.18), CVD (HR=1.66, 95\% CI 1.44-1.91), CKD (HR=1.76, 95\% CI 1.45-2.13), eye disease (HR=1.31, 95\% CI 1.14-1.51), dementia (HR=2.03, 95\% CI 1.33-3.09), depression (HR=3.01, 95\% CI 2.47-3.67), and all-cause mortality (HR=1.81, 95\% CI 1.51-2.16) in the multivariable-adjusted models. Furthermore, with each 1-point increase in FP score, the risk of these adverse outcomes increased by 10\% to 42\%. Robust results were generally observed in sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions: In UK Biobank participants with prediabetes, both prefrailty and frailty are significantly associated with higher risks of multiple adverse outcomes, including T2DM, diabetes-related diseases, and all-cause mortality. Our findings suggest that frailty assessment should be incorporated into routine care for middle-aged adults with prediabetes, to improve the allocation of health care resources and reduce diabetes-related burden.},

Methods COVID-19 cases were defined using health record linkage. Each case was propensity score-matched to two uninfected controls on age, sex, deprivation, body mass index, ethnicity, diabetes, prevalent ischaemic heart disease (IHD), smoking, hypertension and high cholesterol. We included the following incident outcomes: myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism (VTE), pericarditis, all-cause death, cardiovascular death, IHD death. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate associations of COVID-19 with each outcome over an average of 141 days (range 32‚Äì395) of prospective follow-up.
Results Non-hospitalised cases (n=14 304) had increased risk of incident VTE (HR 2.74 (95\% CI 1.38 to 5.45), p=0.004) and death (HR 10.23 (95\% CI 7.63 to 13.70), p{\textless}0.0001). Individuals with primary COVID-19 hospitalisation (n=2701) had increased risk of all outcomes considered. The largest effect sizes were with VTE (HR 27.6 (95\% CI 14.5 to 52.3); p{\textless}0.0001), heart failure (HR 21.6 (95\% CI 10.9 to 42.9); p{\textless}0.0001) and stroke (HR 17.5 (95\% CI 5.26 to 57.9); p{\textless}0.0001). Those hospitalised with COVID-19 as a secondary diagnosis (n=866) had similarly increased cardiovascular risk. The associated risks were greatest in the first 30 days after infection but remained higher than controls even after this period.
Conclusions Individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 have increased risk of incident cardiovascular events across a range of disease and mortality outcomes. The risk of most events is highest in the early postinfection period. Individuals not requiring hospitalisation have increased risk of VTE, but not of other cardiovascular-specific outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background

Therapeutic advances have reduced cardiovascular death rates in people with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We aimed to define the rates of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular death in people with specified CVDs or accruing cardiovascular multimorbidity.

Methods and Results

We studied 493¬†280 UK residents enrolled in the UK Biobank cohort study. The proportion of deaths attributed to cardiovascular, cancer, infection, or other causes were calculated in groups defined by 9 distinct self‚Äêreported CVDs at baseline, or by the number of these CVDs at baseline. Poisson regression analyses were then used to define adjusted incidence rate ratios for these causes of death, accounting for sociodemographic factors and comorbidity. Of 27¬†729 deaths, 20.4\% were primarily attributed to CVD, 53.6\% to cancer, 5.0\% to infection, and 21.0\% to other causes. As cardiovascular multimorbidity increased, the proportion of cardiovascular and infection‚Äêrelated deaths was greater, contrasting with cancer and other deaths. Compared with people without CVD, those with 3 or more CVDs experienced adjusted incidence rate ratios of 7.0 (6.2‚Äì7.8) for cardiovascular death, 4.4 (3.4‚Äì5.6) for infection death, 1.5 (1.4‚Äì1.7) for cancer death, and 2.0 (1.7‚Äì2.4) for other causes of death. There was substantial heterogeneity in causes of death, both in terms of crude proportions and adjusted incidence rate ratios, among the 9 studied baseline CVDs.

Conclusions

Noncardiovascular death is common in people with CVD, although its contribution varies widely between people with different CVDs. Holistic and personalized care are likely to be important tools for continuing to improve outcomes in people with CVD.},

However, existing technologies prevent RNA extraction of small quantities found in neonatal salivary supernatant. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop techniques to enhance extraction of cell-free RNA from neonatal salivary supernatant. Methods: Two saliva samples (10‚Äì100 ¬µl) were serially collected from newborns (36‚Äì41 weeks‚Äô gestation) (n = 13) and stabilized. Total RNA was extracted from salivary supernatant with the use of two modified extraction techniques: Qiagen RNAprotect¬Æ Saliva Mini Kit (method 1) and the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (method 2). Quantitative RT-PCR amplification for GAPDH was performed on extracted salivary samples. Statistical analyses were performed on mean threshold cycle (Ct) levels to compare RNA yield from each protocol. Paired microarray analyses were made between neonatal whole saliva and supernatant (n = 3) to discern gene expression differences between these biolayers. Results: mRNA was successfully extracted and amplified from all salivary supernatant samples. Extraction with method 2 yielded more RNA than with method 1 (p = 0.008). There was a 7.5\% discordance between paired gene expression analyses for whole saliva and supernatant. Genes that were statistically significantly upregulated in supernatant highlighted 16 distinct biological functions not seen in whole saliva. Conversely, only two biological functions were unique to whole saliva. Conclusion: Neonatal cell-free salivary supernatant mRNA may be readily extracted and utilized on downstream applications. These technical enhancements allow for further exploration of the diagnostic potential of the neonatal salivary transcriptome.},

This investigation aimed to: (a) compare the effects of two methods of saliva collection on IL-6 assay; (b) search for correlation between salivary and serum IL-6 in resting and post-exercise conditions; (c) evaluate the IL-6 response to isometric contractions. Seventeen sedentary subjects and fifteen athletes underwent one blood and two salivary draws: saliva was collected chewing on cotton salivettes and using a plastic straw (SA method and ST method, respectively). Afterwards, the athletes only completed a fatiguing isometric exercise of the knee extensors and blood and saliva were sampled after the exercise. In the entire group (n¬†=¬†32), ST method produced higher IL-6 levels than SA method and serum sampling. The exercise elicited significant responses of lactate, serum IL-6, salivary IL-6 (by ST method): salivary IL-6 values using the ST collection method were higher at each sampling point than with the SA method. The correlation analyses applied to both resting levels in the entire group and absolute changes above baseline in the athlete group showed that: (1) no significant relationships exist between serum and salivary IL-6 levels; (2) the greater the salivary IL-6 measurement, the higher the resultant inaccuracy of the SA method; (3) significant correlations exist between isometric force and mechanical fatigue during exercise and peaks of lactate and serum IL-6. These data provided demonstration of a cotton-interference effect for the results of salivary IL-6 assay and confirmed the lack of significant correlation between salivary and serum IL-6 in resting and post-exercise conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: For adults with chest pain, the electrocardiogram (ECG) and measures of serum biomarkers are used to screen and diagnose myocardial necrosis. These measurements require time that can delay therapy and affect prognosis. Our objective was to investigate the feasibility and utility of saliva as an alternative diagnostic fluid for identifying biomarkers of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: We used Luminex and lab-on-a-chip methods to assay 21 proteins in serum and unstimulated whole saliva procured from 41 AMI patients within 48 h of chest pain onset and from 43 apparently healthy controls. Data were analyzed by use of logistic regression and area under curve (AUC) for ROC analysis to evaluate the diagnostic utility of each biomarker, or combinations of biomarkers, in screening for AMI.
RESULTS: Both established and novel cardiac biomarkers demonstrated significant differences in concentrations between patients with AMI and controls without AMI. The saliva-based biomarker panel of C-reactive protein, myoglobin, and myeloperoxidase exhibited significant diagnostic capability (AUC = 0.85, P {\textless} 0.0001) and in conjunction with ECG yielded strong screening capacity for AMI (AUC = 0.96) comparable to that of the panel (brain natriuretic peptide, troponin-I, creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin; AUC = 0.98) and far exceeded the screening capacity of ECG alone (AUC approximately 0.6). En route to translating these findings to clinical practice, we adapted these unstimulated whole saliva tests to a novel lab-on-a-chip platform for proof-of-principle screens for AMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Complementary to ECG, saliva-based tests within lab-on-a-chip systems may provide a convenient and rapid screening method for cardiac events in prehospital stages for AMI patients.},

In agreement with the non-steroidal structure and the high molecular weight of CRP, we observed a low saliva-to-serum CRP ratio (1:1633.64). Furthermore, a dichotomous index of salivary CRP, equivalent to a clinically relevant serum CRP cut-off (3mg/l), was associated to known correlates of systemic inflammation (IL-6, BMI and smoking). Finally, we showed that CRP in saliva is stable at room temperature up to 8h after collection. Our study provides initial evidence suggesting that non-invasive assessment of CRP in saliva allows valid prediction of serum CRP. Salivary CRP may thus facilitate and promote research exploring the correlates of low-grade inflammation in epidemiological studies and makes it feasible to expand psychoneuroimmunology research to pediatric populations.},

	abstract = {There is much evidence showing that physical activity is related to optimal health, including physical and mental function, and quality of life. Additionally, data are accumulating with regards to the detrimental health impacts of sedentary behavior. Much of the evidence related to long-term health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer ‚Äì the two leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide, comes from observational epidemiologic studies and, in particular, prospective cohort studies. Few data on these outcomes are derived from randomized controlled trials, conventionally regarded as the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù of research designs. Why is there a paucity of data from randomized trials on physical activity or sedentary behavior and long-term health outcomes? A further issue to consider is that prospective cohort studies investigating these outcomes can take a long time to accrue sufficient numbers of endpoints for robust and meaningful findings. This contrasts with the rapid pace at which technology advances. Thus, while the use of devices for measuring physical behaviors has been an important development in large-scale epidemiologic studies over the past decade, cohorts that are now publishing results on health outcomes related to accelerometer-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior may have been initiated years ago, using ‚Äúdated‚Äù technology. This paper, based on a keynote presentation at ICAMPAM 2022, discusses the issues of study design and slow pace of discovery in prospective cohort studies and suggests some possible ways to maximize the utility and comparability of ‚Äúdated‚Äù device data from prospective cohort studies for research investigations, using the Women‚Äôs Health Study as an example.},

	abstract = {Background
Higher levels of physical activity (PA) are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, uncertainty exists on whether the inverse relationship between PA and incidence of CVD is greater at the highest levels of PA. Past studies have mostly relied on self-reported evidence from questionnaire-based PA, which is crude and cannot capture all PA undertaken. We investigated the association between accelerometer-measured moderate, vigorous, and total PA and incident CVD.

Methods and findings
We obtained accelerometer-measured moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity physical activities and total volume of PA, over a 7-day period in 2013‚Äì2015, for 90,211 participants without prior or concurrent CVD in the UK Biobank cohort. Participants in the lowest category of total PA smoked more, had higher body mass index and C-reactive protein, and were diagnosed with hypertension. PA was associated with 3,617 incident CVD cases during 440,004 person-years of follow-up (median (interquartile range [IQR]): 5.2 (1.2) years) using Cox regression models. We found a linear dose‚Äìresponse relationship for PA, whether measured as moderate-intensity, vigorous-intensity, or as total volume, with risk of incident of CVD. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals for increasing quarters of the PA distribution relative to the lowest fourth were for moderate-intensity PA: 0.71 (0.65, 0.77), 0.59 (0.54, 0.65), and 0.46 (0.41, 0.51); for vigorous-intensity PA: 0.70 (0.64, 0.77), 0.54 (0.49,0.59), and 0.41 (0.37,0.46); and for total volume of PA: 0.73 (0.67, 0.79), 0.63 (0.57, 0.69), and 0.47 (0.43, 0.52). We took account of potential confounders but unmeasured confounding remains a possibility, and while removal of early deaths did not affect the estimated HRs, we cannot completely dismiss the likelihood that reverse causality has contributed to the findings. Another possible limitation of this work is the quantification of PA intensity-levels based on methods validated in relatively small studies.

Conclusions
In this study, we found no evidence of a threshold for the inverse association between objectively measured moderate, vigorous, and total PA with CVD. Our findings suggest that PA is not only associated with lower risk for of CVD, but the greatest benefit is seen for those who are active at the highest level.

	abstract = {Use of wearable devices that monitor physical activity is projected to increase more than fivefold per half-decade1. We investigated how device-based physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and different intensity profiles were associated with all-cause mortality. We used a network harmonization approach to map dominant-wrist acceleration to PAEE in 96,476 UK Biobank participants (mean age 62 years, 56\% female). We also calculated the fraction of PAEE accumulated from moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA). Over the median 3.1-year follow-up period (302,526 person-years), 732 deaths were recorded. Higher PAEE was associated with a lower hazard of all-cause mortality for a constant fraction of MVPA (for example, 21\% (95\% confidence interval 4‚Äì35\%) lower hazard for 20 versus 15‚ÄâkJ‚Äâkg‚àí1‚Äâd‚àí1 PAEE with 10\% from MVPA). Similarly, a higher MVPA fraction was associated with a lower hazard when PAEE remained constant (for example, 30\% (8‚Äì47\%) lower hazard when 20\% versus 10\% of a fixed 15‚ÄâkJ‚Äâkg‚àí1‚Äâd‚àí1 PAEE volume was from MVPA). Our results show that higher volumes of PAEE are associated with reduced mortality rates, and achieving the same volume through higher-intensity activity is associated with greater reductions than through lower-intensity activity. The linkage of device-measured activity to energy expenditure creates a framework for using wearables for personalized prevention.},

For example, we find that men spend more time in both low- and high- intensity behaviours, while women spend more time in mixed behaviours. Walking time is highest in spring and sleep time lowest during the summer. This work opens the possibility of future public health guidelines informed by the health consequences associated with specific, objectively measured, physical activity and sleep behaviours.},

Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of device-measured physical activity and sleep duration in 91,105 UK Biobank participants, finding 14 significant loci (7 novel). These loci account for 0.06\% of activity and 0.39\% of sleep duration variation. Genome-wide estimates of {\textasciitilde}‚Äâ15\% phenotypic variation indicate high polygenicity. Heritability is higher in women than men for overall activity (23 vs. 20\%, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.5‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí4) and sedentary behaviours (18 vs. 15\%, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ9.7‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí4).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To improve classification of movement behaviours in free-living accelerometer data using machine-learning methods, and to investigate the association between machine-learned movement behaviours and risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults.
METHODS: Using free-living data from 152 participants, we developed a machine-learning model to classify movement behaviours (moderate-to-vigorous physical activity behaviours (MVPA), light physical activity behaviours, sedentary behaviour, sleep) in wrist-worn accelerometer data. Participants in UK Biobank, a prospective cohort, were asked to wear an accelerometer for 7‚Äâdays, and we applied our machine-learning model to classify their movement behaviours. Using compositional data analysis Cox regression, we investigated how reallocating time between movement behaviours was associated with CVD incidence.
RESULTS: In leave-one-participant-out analysis, our machine-learning method classified free-living movement behaviours with mean accuracy 88\% (95\% CI 87\% to 89\%) and Cohen's kappa 0.80 (95\% CI 0.79 to 0.82). Among 87‚Äâ498 UK Biobank participants, there were 4105 incident CVD events. Reallocating time from any behaviour to MVPA, or reallocating time from sedentary behaviour to any behaviour, was associated with lower CVD risk. For an average individual, reallocating 20‚Äâmin/day to MVPA from all other behaviours proportionally was associated with 9\% (95\% CI 7\% to 10\%) lower risk, while reallocating 1‚Äâhour/day to sedentary behaviour from all other behaviours proportionally was associated with 5\% (95\% CI 3\% to 7\%) higher risk.
CONCLUSION: Machine-learning methods classified movement behaviours accurately in free-living accelerometer data. Reallocating time from other behaviours to MVPA, and from sedentary behaviour to other behaviours, was associated with lower risk of incident CVD, and should be promoted by interventions and guidelines.},

	abstract = {Physical activity improves quality of life, physical health and mental health, and is also an important protective factor against highly prevalent age-related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and mental health. With age, physical activity tends to decrease, leading down a vicious cycle that increases vulnerability to disease in the elderly. In the following, we trained neural network architectures to predict age from 115,456 one week-long 100Hz wrist accelerometer recordings from the UK Biobank (R-Squared=63.5¬±2.4\%; root mean squared error=4.7¬±0.1 years). We achieved this performance by preprocessing the raw data as 2,271 scalar features, 113 time series and four images. We also considered the raw signal at different time scales (weekly activity patterns vs. gait). We then defined accelerated aging for a participant as being predicted older than one‚Äôs actual age and aimed to characterize these participants. We performed a genome wide association on the accelerated aging phenotypes to estimate its heritability (h\_g2=12.3¬±0.9\%) and identified nine single nucleotide polymorphisms in seven genes associated with it (e.g HIST1H4L, involved in chromatin organization). Similarly, we identified biomarkers (e.g blood pressure), clinical phenotypes (e.g chest pain), diseases (e.g hypertension), environmental (e.g smoking) and socioeconomic (e.g income and education) variables associated with accelerated aging. We conclude that physical activity-derived biological age is a complex phenotype with both genetic and non-genetic factors.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of accelerometer-measured sleep duration and different intensities of physical activity (PA) with the risk of incident type 2 diabetes in a population-based prospective cohort study.
Methods
Altogether, 88,000 participants (mean age =‚ÄØ62.2 ¬± 7.9 years, mean ¬± SD) were included from the UK Biobank. Sleep duration (short: {\textless}6 h/day; normal: 6‚Äì8 h/day; long: {\textgreater}8 h/day) and PA of different intensities were measured using a wrist-worn accelerometer over a 7-day period between 2013 and 2015. PA was classified according to the median or World Health Organization-recommendation: total volume of PA (high, low), moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) (recommended, not recommended), and light-intensity PA (high, low). Incidence of type 2 diabetes was ascertained using hospital records or death registries.
Results
During a median follow-up of 7.0 years, 1615 incident type 2 diabetes cases were documented. Compared with normal sleep duration, short (hazard ratio (HR)‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.21, 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI): 1.03‚Äì1.41) but not long sleep duration (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.01, 95\%CI: 0.89‚Äì1.15) was associated with excessive type 2 diabetes risk. This increased risk among short sleepers seems to be protected against by PA. Compared with normal sleepers with high or recommended PA, short sleepers with low volume of PA (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.81, 95\%CI: 1.46‚Äì2.25), not recommended (below the World Health Organization‚Äìrecommended level of) moderate-to-vigorous PA (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.92, 95\%CI: 1.55‚Äì2.36), or low light-intensity PA (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.49, 95\%CI: 1.13‚Äì1.90) had a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, while short sleepers with a high volume of PA (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.14, 95\%CI: 0.88‚Äì1.49), recommended moderate-to-vigorous PA (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.02, 95\%CI: 0.71‚Äì1.48), or high light-intensity PA (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.14, 95\%CI: 0.92‚Äì1.41) did not.
Conclusion
Accelerometer-measured short but not long sleep duration was associated with a higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes. A higher level of PA, regardless of intensity, potentially ameliorates this excessive risk.},

	abstract = {Background
Given the evolution of processing and analysis methods for accelerometry data over the past decade, it is important to understand how newer summary measures of physical activity compare with established measures.

Objective
We aimed to compare objective measures of physical activity to increase the generalizability and translation of findings of studies that use accelerometry-based data.

Methods
High-resolution accelerometry data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging were retrospectively analyzed. Data from 655 participants who used a wrist-worn ActiGraph GT9X device continuously for a week were summarized at the minute level as ActiGraph activity count, monitor-independent movement summary, Euclidean norm minus one, mean amplitude deviation, and activity intensity. We calculated these measures using open-source packages in R. Pearson correlations between activity count and each measure were quantified both marginally and conditionally on age, sex, and BMI. Each measures pair was harmonized using nonparametric regression of minute-level data.

Results
Data were from a sample (N=655; male: n=298, 45.5\%; female: n=357, 54.5\%) with a mean age of 69.8 years (SD 14.2) and mean BMI of 27.3 kg/m2 (SD 5.0). The mean marginal participant-specific correlations between activity count and monitor-independent movement summary, Euclidean norm minus one, mean amplitude deviation, and activity were r=0.988 (SE 0.0002324), r=0.867 (SE 0.001841), r=0.913 (SE 0.00132), and r=0.970 (SE 0.0006868), respectively. After harmonization, mean absolute percentage errors of predicting total activity count from monitor-independent movement summary, Euclidean norm minus one, mean amplitude deviation, and activity intensity were 2.5, 14.3, 11.3, and 6.3, respectively. The accuracies for predicting sedentary minutes for an activity count cut-off of 1853 using monitor-independent movement summary, Euclidean norm minus one, mean amplitude deviation, and activity intensity were 0.981, 0.928, 0.904, and 0.960, respectively. An R software package called SummarizedActigraphy, with a unified interface for computation of the measures from raw accelerometry data, was developed and published.

Conclusions
The findings from this comparison of accelerometry-based measures of physical activity can be used by researchers and facilitate the extension of knowledge from existing literature by demonstrating the high correlation between activity count and monitor-independent movement summary (and other measures) and by providing harmonization mapping.},

Disruption of circadian rhythm might be a risk factor for brain disorder incidents. From 7-day accelerometry data of 72,242 participants in UK Biobank, we derived a circadian relative amplitude variable, which to some extent reflected the degree of circadian rhythm disruption. Records of brain disorder incidents were obtained from a wide range of health outcomes across self-report, primary care, hospital inpatient data, and death data. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio regression, we created two models adjusting for different covariates. Then, linear correlations between relative amplitude and several brain morphometric measures were examined in participants with brain MRI data. After a median follow-up of around 6.1 years, 72,242 participants were included in the current study (female 54.9\%; mean age 62.1 years). Individuals with reduced relative amplitude had increasing risk of all-cause dementia (Hazard ratio 1.23 [95\% CI 1.15 to 1.31]), PD (1.33 [1.25 to 1.41]), stroke (1.13 [1.06 to 1.22]), MDD (1.18 [1.13 to 1.23]), and anxiety disorder (1.14 [1.09 to 1.20]) in fully adjusted models. Additionally, significant correlations were found between several cortical regions and white matter tracts and relative amplitude that have been linked to dementia and psychiatric disorders. We confirm CRD to be a risk factor for various brain disorders. Interventions for regulating circadian rhythm may have clinical relevance to reducing the risk of various brain disorders.},

	abstract = {Introduction Human body acceleration is often used as an indicator of daily physical activity in epidemiological research. Raw acceleration signals contain three basic components: movement, gravity, and noise. Separation of these becomes increasingly difficult during rotational movements. We aimed to evaluate five different methods (metrics) of processing acceleration signals on their ability to remove the gravitational component of acceleration during standardised mechanical movements and the implications for human daily physical activity assessment. Methods An industrial robot rotated accelerometers in the vertical plane. Radius, frequency, and angular range of motion were systematically varied. Three metrics (Euclidian norm minus one [ENMO], Euclidian norm of the high-pass filtered signals [HFEN], and HFEN plus Euclidean norm of low-pass filtered signals minus 1 g [HFEN+]) were derived for each experimental condition and compared against the reference acceleration (forward kinematics) of the robot arm. We then compared metrics derived from human acceleration signals from the wrist and hip in 97 adults (22‚Äì65 yr), and wrist in 63 women (20‚Äì35 yr) in whom daily activity-related energy expenditure (PAEE) was available. Results In the robot experiment, HFEN+ had lowest error during (vertical plane) rotations at an oscillating frequency higher than the filter cut-off frequency while for lower frequencies ENMO performed better. In the human experiments, metrics HFEN and ENMO on hip were most discrepant (within- and between-individual explained variance of 0.90 and 0.46, respectively). ENMO, HFEN and HFEN+ explained 34\%, 30\% and 36\% of the variance in daily PAEE, respectively, compared to 26\% for a metric which did not attempt to remove the gravitational component (metric EN). Conclusion In conclusion, none of the metrics as evaluated systematically outperformed all other metrics across a wide range of standardised kinematic conditions. However, choice of metric explains different degrees of variance in daily human physical activity.},

	abstract = {Objectives (1) To develop and internally-validate Euclidean Norm Minus One (ENMO) and Mean Amplitude Deviation (MAD) thresholds for separating sedentary behaviours from common light-intensity physical activities using raw acceleration data collected from both hip- and wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometers; and (2) to compare and evaluate the performances between the ENMO and MAD metrics. Methods Thirty-three adults [mean age (standard deviation (SD)) = 27.4 (5.9) years; mean BMI (SD) = 23.9 (3.7) kg/m2; 20 females (60.6\%)] wore four accelerometers; an ActiGraph GT3X+ and a GENEActiv on the right hip; and an ActiGraph GT3X+ and a GENEActiv on the non-dominant wrist. Under laboratory-conditions, participants performed 16 different activities (11 sedentary behaviours and 5 light-intensity physical activities) for 5 minutes each. ENMO and MAD were computed from the raw acceleration data, and logistic regression and receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analyses were implemented to derive thresholds for activity discrimination. Areas under ROC curves (AUROC) were calculated to summarise performances and thresholds were assessed via executing leave-one-out-cross-validations. Results For both hip and wrist monitor placements, in comparison to the ActiGraph GT3X+ monitors, the ENMO and MAD values derived from the GENEActiv devices were observed to be slightly higher, particularly for the lower-intensity activities. Monitor-specific hip and wrist ENMO and MAD thresholds showed excellent ability for separating sedentary behaviours from motion-based light-intensity physical activities (in general, AUROCs {\textgreater}0.95), with validation indicating robustness. However, poor classification was experienced when attempting to isolate standing still from sedentary behaviours (in general, AUROCs {\textless}0.65). The ENMO and MAD metrics tended to perform similarly across activities and accelerometer brands. Conclusions Researchers can utilise these robust monitor-specific hip and wrist ENMO and MAD thresholds, in order to accurately separate sedentary behaviours from common motion-based light-intensity physical activities. However, caution should be taken if isolating sedentary behaviours from standing is of particular interest.},

	abstract = {Background: Disturbed sleep and irregular sleep-wake patterns have been associated with poor outcomes in older adults. Sleep regularity however has not been studied in a sample with current or remitted major depression. Methods: 138 participants (63.8¬±8.6 years; n=27 current major depression, n=64 remitted, and n=47 healthy controls) were monitored using wrist-worn actigraphy. The Sleep Regularity Index (SRI), sleep-wake fragmentation and stability, sleep onset and offset timing, number of awakenings and measures from cosinor analysis were computed. Results: Compared with controls, older adults with current depression had lower SRI (p {\textless} 0.01), lower relative amplitude (p {\textless} 0.05), and higher activity during sleeping and post-midnight hours (p {\textless} 0.05). Older adults with remitted depression displayed lower activity during the day (p {\textless} 0.05), showed reduced average activity and lower amplitude than controls. Total sleep time, sleep timing, and number of awakenings did not differ between groups. All groups differed significantly in self-reported sleep quality and depression severity. Limitations: Longitudinal studies which examine how sleep-wake patterns change based on depressive episode recency, severity and how medications may influence these patterns are needed. Conclusions: Older adults with current or remitted major depression do not differ from controls on traditional sleep metrics but do report poor quality sleep and show differences in sleep regularity and rest-activity patterns. Reducing the risk of poor outcomes in both groups may be aided by interventions that help promote sleep regularity and increased activity.},

We used data-driven, unsupervised time series modelling to characterize distinct profiles of the circadian rhythm measured from skin surface temperature in free-living conditions. We demonstrate the existence of three distinct clusters of individuals which differed in their circadian temperature profiles. The cluster with the highest temperature amplitude and the lowest midline estimating statistic of rhythm, or rhythm-adjusted mean, had the most regular and early-timed sleep‚Äìwake rhythm, and was the least probable for those with a concurrent delayed sleep phase, or eveningness chronotype. While the clusters associated with the observed sleep and circadian preference patterns, the entirely unsupervised modelling of physiological data provides a novel basis for modelling and understanding the human circadian functions in free-living conditions.},

We report organ age profiles for 16 chronic diseases, where advanced biological aging extends from the organ of primary disease to multiple systems. Advanced body age associates with several lifestyle and environmental factors, leukocyte telomere lengths and mortality risk, and predicts survival time (area under the curve of 0.77) and premature death (area under the curve of 0.86).

To test this hypothesis, we evaluated prospective associations between biological age and incident depression and anxiety in 424,299 UK Biobank participants.

	abstract = {Application of biological age as a measure of an individual¬¥s health status offers new perspectives into extension of both lifespan and healthspan. While algorithms predicting mortality and most aging-related morbidities have been reported, the major shortcoming has been an inability to predict dementia. We present a community-based cohort study of 1930 participants with a mean age of 72¬†years and a follow-up period of over 7¬†years, using two variants of a phenotypic blood-based algorithm that either excludes (BioAge1) or includes (BioAge2) neurofilament light chain (NfL) as a neurodegenerative marker. BioAge1 and BioAge2 predict dementia equally well, as well as lifespan and healthspan. Each one-year increase in BioAge1/2 was associated with 11\% elevated risk (HR 1.11; 95\%CI 1.08‚Äì1.14) of mortality and 7\% elevated risk (HR 1.07; 95\%CI 1.05‚Äì1.09) of first morbidities. We additionally tested the association of microRNAs with age and identified 263 microRNAs significantly associated with biological and chronological age alike. Top differentially expressed microRNAs based on biological age had a higher significance level than those based on chronological age, suggesting that biological age captures aspects of aging signals at the epigenetic level. We conclude that accelerated biological age for a given age is a predictor of major age-related morbidity, including dementia, among healthy elderly.},

	abstract = {Background
Peritoneal recurrence is the predominant pattern of relapse after curative-intent surgery for gastric cancer and portends a dismal prognosis. Accurate individualised prediction of peritoneal recurrence is crucial to identify patients who might benefit from intensive treatment. We aimed to develop predictive models for peritoneal recurrence and prognosis in gastric cancer.

Methods
In this retrospective multi-institution study of 2320 patients, we developed a multitask deep learning model for the simultaneous prediction of peritoneal recurrence and disease-free survival using preoperative CT images. Patients in the training cohort (n=510) and the internal validation cohort (n=767) were recruited from Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China. Patients in the external validation cohort (n=1043) were recruited from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China. We evaluated the prognostic accuracy of the model as well as its association with chemotherapy response. Furthermore, we assessed whether the model could improve the ability of clinicians to predict peritoneal recurrence.

Findings
The deep learning model had a consistently high accuracy in predicting peritoneal recurrence in the training cohort (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0¬∑857; 95\% CI 0¬∑826‚Äì0¬∑889), internal validation cohort (0¬∑856; 0¬∑829‚Äì0¬∑882), and external validation cohort (0¬∑843; 0¬∑819‚Äì0¬∑866). When informed by the artificial intelligence (AI) model, the sensitivity and inter-rater agreement of oncologists for predicting peritoneal recurrence was improved. The model was able to predict disease-free survival in the training cohort (C-index 0¬∑654; 95\% CI 0¬∑616‚Äì0¬∑691), internal validation cohort (0¬∑668; 0¬∑643‚Äì0¬∑693), and external validation cohort (0¬∑610; 0¬∑583‚Äì0¬∑636). In multivariable analysis, the model predicted peritoneal recurrence and disease-free survival independently of clinicopathological variables (p{\textless}0¬∑0001 for all). For patients with a predicted high risk of peritoneal recurrence and low survival, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved disease-free survival in both stage II disease (hazard ratio [HR] 0¬∑543 [95\% CI 0¬∑362‚Äì0¬∑815]; p=0¬∑003) and stage III disease (0¬∑531 [0¬∑432‚Äì0¬∑652]; p{\textless}0¬∑0001). By contrast, chemotherapy had no impact on disease-free survival for patients with a predicted low risk of peritoneal recurrence and high survival. For the remaining patients, the benefit of chemotherapy depended on stage: only those with stage III disease derived benefit from chemotherapy (HR 0¬∑637 [95\% CI 0¬∑484‚Äì0¬∑838]; p=0¬∑001).

Interpretation
The deep learning model could allow accurate prediction of peritoneal recurrence and survival in patients with gastric cancer. Prospective studies are required to test the clinical utility of this model in guiding personalised treatment in combination with clinicopathological criteria.

	abstract = {Purpose
The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of accelerometer-measured sleep duration and different intensities of physical activity (PA) with the risk of incident type 2 diabetes in a population-based prospective cohort study.
Methods
Altogether, 88,000 participants (mean age =‚ÄØ62.2 ¬± 7.9 years, mean ¬± SD) were included from the UK Biobank. Sleep duration (short: {\textless}6 h/day; normal: 6‚Äì8 h/day; long: {\textgreater}8 h/day) and PA of different intensities were measured using a wrist-worn accelerometer over a 7-day period between 2013 and 2015. PA was classified according to the median or World Health Organization-recommendation: total volume of PA (high, low), moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) (recommended, not recommended), and light-intensity PA (high, low). Incidence of type 2 diabetes was ascertained using hospital records or death registries.
Results
During a median follow-up of 7.0 years, 1615 incident type 2 diabetes cases were documented. Compared with normal sleep duration, short (hazard ratio (HR)‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.21, 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI): 1.03‚Äì1.41) but not long sleep duration (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.01, 95\%CI: 0.89‚Äì1.15) was associated with excessive type 2 diabetes risk. This increased risk among short sleepers seems to be protected against by PA. Compared with normal sleepers with high or recommended PA, short sleepers with low volume of PA (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.81, 95\%CI: 1.46‚Äì2.25), not recommended (below the World Health Organization‚Äìrecommended level of) moderate-to-vigorous PA (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.92, 95\%CI: 1.55‚Äì2.36), or low light-intensity PA (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.49, 95\%CI: 1.13‚Äì1.90) had a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, while short sleepers with a high volume of PA (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.14, 95\%CI: 0.88‚Äì1.49), recommended moderate-to-vigorous PA (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.02, 95\%CI: 0.71‚Äì1.48), or high light-intensity PA (HR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.14, 95\%CI: 0.92‚Äì1.41) did not.
Conclusion
Accelerometer-measured short but not long sleep duration was associated with a higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes. A higher level of PA, regardless of intensity, potentially ameliorates this excessive risk.},

	abstract = {Sleep is an essential human function but its regulation is poorly understood. Using accelerometer data from 85,670 UK Biobank participants, we perform a genome-wide association study of 8 derived sleep traits representing sleep quality, quantity and timing, and validate our findings in 5,819 individuals. We identify 47 genetic associations at P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ5‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí8, of which 20 reach a stricter threshold of P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ8‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí10. These include 26 novel associations with measures of sleep quality and 10 with nocturnal sleep duration. The majority of identified variants associate with a single sleep trait, except for variants previously associated with restless legs syndrome. For sleep duration we identify a missense variant (p.Tyr727Cys) in PDE11A as the likely causal variant. As a group, sleep quality loci are enriched for serotonin processing genes. Although accelerometer-derived measures of sleep are imperfect and may be affected by restless legs syndrome, these findings provide new biological insights into sleep compared to previous efforts based on self-report sleep measures.},

We report here a cross-sectional analysis of 72 million SpO2 values collected from 33,080 individual participants in the Apple Heart and Movement Study, stratified by age, sex, body mass index (BMI), home altitude, and other demographic variables. Measurements aggregated by hour of day into 24-h SpO2 profiles exhibit similar circadian patterns for all demographic groups, being approximately sinusoidal with nadir near midnight local time, zenith near noon local time, and mean 0.8\% lower saturation during overnight hours. Using SpO2 measurements averaged for each subject into mean nocturnal and daytime SpO2 values, we employ multivariate ordinary least squares regression to quantify population-level trends according to demographic factors. For the full cohort, regression coefficients obtained from models fit to daytime SpO2 are in close quantitative agreement with the corresponding values from published reference models for awake arterial oxygen saturation measured under controlled laboratory conditions. Regression models stratified by sex reveal significantly different age- and BMI-dependent SpO2 trends for females compared with males, although constant terms and regression coefficients for altitude do not differ between sexes. Incorporating categorical variables encoding self-reported race/ethnicity into the full-cohort regression models identifies small but statistically significant differences in daytime SpO2 (largest coefficient corresponding to 0.13\% lower SpO2, for Hispanic study participants compared to White participants), but no significant differences between groups for nocturnal SpO2. Additional stratified analysis comparing regression models fit independently to subjects in each race/ethnicity group is suggestive of small differences in age- and sex-dependent trends, but indicates no significant difference in constant terms between any race/ethnicity groups for either daytime or nocturnal SpO2. The large diverse study population and study design employing automated background SpO2 measurements spanning the full 24-h circadian cycle enables the establishment of healthy population reference trends outside of clinical settings.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide studies often exclude family members, even though they are a valuable source of information. We identified parent-offspring pairs, siblings and couples in the UK Biobank and implemented a family-based DNA-derived heritability method to capture additional genetic effects and multiple sources of environmental influence on neuroticism and years of education. Compared to estimates from unrelated individuals, total heritability increased from 10 to 27\% and from 17 to 56\% for neuroticism and education respectively by including family-based genetic effects. We detected no family environmental influences on neuroticism. The couple similarity variance component explained 35\% of the variation in years of education, probably reflecting assortative mating. Overall, our genetic and environmental estimates closely replicate previous findings from an independent sample. However, more research is required to dissect contributions to the additional heritability by rare and structural genetic effects, assortative mating, and residual environmental confounding. The latter is especially relevant for years of education, a highly socially contingent variable, for which our heritability estimate is at the upper end of twin estimates in the literature. Family-based genetic effects could be harnessed to improve polygenic prediction.},

We use genetics (GWAS-by-subtraction) to assess a latent, broad non-cognitive skills dimension. To index parental effects controlling for genetic transmission, we estimate indirect parental genetic effects of polygenic scores on childhood and adulthood educational outcomes, using siblings (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ47,459), adoptees (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ6407), and parent-offspring trios (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ2534) in three UK and Dutch cohorts. We find that parental cognitive and non-cognitive skills affect offspring education through their environment: on average across cohorts and designs, indirect genetic effects explain 36‚Äì40\% of population polygenic score associations. However, indirect genetic effects are lower for achievement in the Dutch cohort, and for the adoption design. We identify potential causes of higher sibling- and trio-based estimates: prenatal indirect genetic effects, population stratification, and assortative mating.

	abstract = {Using DNA methylation profiles (n = 15,456) from 348 mammalian species, we constructed phyloepigenetic trees that bear marked similarities to traditional phylogenetic ones. Using unsupervised clustering across all samples, we identified 55 distinct cytosine modules, of which 30 are related to traits such as maximum life span, adult weight, age, sex, and human mortality risk. Maximum life span is associated with methylation levels in HOXL subclass homeobox genes and developmental processes and is potentially regulated by pluripotency transcription factors. The methylation state of some modules responds to perturbations such as caloric restriction, ablation of growth hormone receptors, consumption of high-fat diets, and expression of Yamanaka factors. This study reveals an intertwined evolution of the genome and epigenome that mediates the biological characteristics and traits of different mammalian species.},

In addition, compared with morning group ({\textgreater}50\% of daily MVPA during 05:00-11:00), midday-afternoon (11:00-17:00) and mixed MVPA timing groups, but not evening group (17:00-24:00), have lower risks of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. These protective associations are more pronounced among the elderly, males, less physically active participants, or those with preexisting cardiovascular diseases.

	abstract = {Background
Associations between driving and physical-activity (PA) intensities are unclear, particularly among older adults. We estimated prospective associations of travel modes with total PA, sedentary time (ST), light-intensity PA (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) among adults aged 39‚Äì70‚Äâyears.

Methods
We studied 90‚Äâ810 UK Biobank participants (56.1‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ7.8‚Äâyears). Driving status, specific travel modes (non-work travel; commuting to/from work) and covariates were assessed by questionnaire (2006‚Äì10). PA was assessed over 7‚Äâdays by wrist-worn accelerometers (2013‚Äì15). We estimated associations using overall and age-stratified multivariable linear-regression models.

Results
Drivers accumulated 1.4\% more total PA (95\% confidence interval: 0.9, 1.9), 11.2‚Äâmin/day less ST (‚Äì12.9, ‚Äì9.5), 12.2‚Äâmin/day more LPA (11.0, 13.3) and 0.9‚Äâmin/day less MVPA (‚Äì1.6, ‚Äì0.2) than non-drivers. Compared with car/motor-vehicle users, cyclists and walkers had the most optimal activity profiles followed by mixed-mode users (e.g. for non-work travel, cyclists: 10.7\% more total PA, 9.0, 12.4; 20.5‚Äâmin/day less ST, ‚Äì26.0, ‚Äì15.0; 14.5‚Äâmin/day more MVPA, 12.0, 17.2; walkers: 4.2\% more total PA, 3.5, 5.0; 7.5‚Äâmin/day less ST ‚Äì10.2, ‚Äì4.9; 10.1‚Äâmin/day more MVPA, 8.9, 11.3; mixed-mode users: 2.3\% more total PA, 1.9, 2.7; 3.4‚Äâmin/day less ST ‚Äì4.8, ‚Äì2.1; 4.9‚Äâmin/day more MVPA, 4.3, 5.5). Some associations varied by age (p interaction‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.05), but these differences appeared small.

Conclusions
Assessing specific travel modes rather than driving status alone may better capture variations in activity. Walking, cycling and, to a lesser degree, mixed-mode use are associated with more optimal activity profiles in adults of all ages.},

A total of 104 overweight/obese children (10.1¬†¬±¬†1.1¬†years old, 43 girls) concurrently wore ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers on their right hip and non-dominant wrist for 7¬†days (24¬†hours). Euclidean norm -1¬†g (ENMO) and activity counts from both vertical axis (VACounts) and vector magnitude (VMCounts) were derived. We calculated estimates of SED and light, moderate, vigorous, and moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) intensity PA using different published cut-points for children. The prevalence of children meeting the recommended 60¬†min/d of MVPA was calculated. The time spent in SED and the different PA intensities largely differed across cut-points based on different attachment sites and acceleration metrics (ie, SED¬†=¬†11-252¬†min/d; light PA¬†=¬†10-217¬†min/d; moderate PA¬†=¬†1-48¬†min/d; vigorous PA¬†=¬†1-35¬†min/d; MVPA¬†=¬†4-66¬†min/d). Consequently, the prevalence of children meeting the recommended 60¬†min/d of MVPA varied from 8\% to 96\% of the study sample. The present study provides a comprehensive comparison between available cut-points for different attachment and acceleration metrics in children. Furthermore, our data clearly show that it is not possible (and probably will never be) to know the prevalence of meeting the PA guidelines based on accelerometer data since apparent differences range from almost zero to nearly everyone meeting the guidelines.},

          The study aims were to compare raw triaxial accelerometer output from ActiGraph GT3X+ (AG) and GENEActiv (GA) placed on the hip and the wrist and to develop regression equations for estimating energy expenditure.
          Methods¬†
          Thirty children (7‚Äì11 yr) and 30 adults (18‚Äì65 yr) completed eight activities (ranging from lying to running) while wearing one AG and one GA on the hip and the wrist. Oxygen consumption (VÀôO2) was measured with indirect calorimetry. Analysis involved the use of ANOVA to examine the effect of activity, brand, and placement on the acceleration values, intraclass correlation coefficient to evaluate the agreement between the two brands and placements, and linear regression to establish intensity thresholds.
          Results¬†
          A significant difference in acceleration values between the hip and the wrist placement was found (P {\textless} 0.001). The output from the wrist placement was, in general, higher compared with that from the hip. There was no main effect of monitor brand in adults (P {\textless} 0.12) and children (P {\textless} 0.73), and the intraclass correlation coefficient showed a strong agreement (0.96‚Äì0.99). However, a three-way interaction and systematic error between the brands was found in children. Acceleration from both brands and placements showed a strong correlation with VÀôO2. The intensity classification accuracy of the developed thresholds for both brands and placements was, in general, higher for adults compared with that for children and was greater for sedentary/light (93\%‚Äì97\%), and vigorous activities (68\%‚Äì92\%) than that for moderate activities (33\%‚Äì59\%).

          Accelerometer outputs from AG and GA seem comparable when attached to the same body location in adults, whereas inconsistent differences are apparent between the two brands and placements in children, hence limiting the comparability between brands in this age group.},

This study aimed to assess the comparability of acceleration metrics between commonly-used body-attachment locations for 24‚Äâhours, waking and sleeping hours, and to test comparability of PA cut points between dominant and non-dominant wrist. Forty-five young adults (23 women, 18‚Äì41 years) were included and GT3X‚Äâ+‚Äâaccelerometers (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) were placed on their right hip, dominant, and non-dominant wrist for 7 days. We derived Euclidean Norm Minus One g (ENMO), Low-pass filtered ENMO (LFENMO), Mean Amplitude Deviation (MAD) and ActiGraph activity counts over 5-second epochs from the raw accelerations. Metric values were compared using a correlation analysis, and by plotting the differences by time of the day. Cut points for the dominant wrist were derived using Lin‚Äôs concordance correlation coefficient optimization in a grid of possible thresholds, using the non-dominant wrist estimates as reference. They were cross-validated in a separate sample (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ36, 10 women, 22‚Äì30 years). Shared variances between pairs of acceleration metrics varied across sites and metric pairs (range in r2: 0.19‚Äì0.97, all p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.01), suggesting that some sites and metrics are associated, and others are not. We observed higher metric values in dominant vs. non-dominant wrist, thus, we developed cut points for dominant wrist based on ENMO to classify sedentary time ({\textless}50‚Äâmg), light PA (50‚Äì110‚Äâmg), moderate PA (110‚Äì440‚Äâmg) and vigorous PA (‚â•440‚Äâmg). Our findings suggest differences between dominant and non-dominant wrist, and we proposed new cut points to attenuate these differences. ENMO and LFENMO were the most similar metrics, and they showed good comparability with MAD. However, counts were not comparable with ENMO, LFENMO and MAD.},

Data from 59 older adults were used for calibration and from 21 independent participants for cross-validation purposes.

To quantify the association between accelerometer-assessed physical activity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes.
Methods
Data from 82,253 UK Biobank participants with accelerometer data (measured 2013-2015), complete covariate data, and linked COVID-19 data from March 16, 2020, to March 16, 2021, were included. Two outcomes were investigated: severe COVID-19 (positive test result from in-hospital setting or COVID-19 as primary cause of death) and nonsevere COVID-19 (positive test result from community setting). Logistic regressions were used to assess associations with moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), total activity, and intensity gradient. A higher intensity gradient indicates a higher proportion of vigorous activity.
Results
Average MVPA was 48.1 (32.7) min/d. Physical activity was associated with lower odds of severe COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio per standard deviation increase: MVPA, 0.75 [95\% CI, 0.67 to 0.85]; total, 0.83 [0.74 to 0.92]; intensity, 0.77 [0.70 to 0.86]), with stronger associations in women (MVPA, 0.63 [0.52 to 0.77]; total, 0.76 [0.64 to 0.90]; intensity, 0.63 [0.53 to 0.74]) than in men (MVPA, 0.84 [0.73 to 0.97]; total, 0.88 [0.77 to 1.01]; intensity, 0.88 [0.77 to 1.00]). In contrast, when mutually adjusted, total activity was associated with higher odds of a nonsevere infection (1.10 [1.04 to 1.16]), whereas the intensity gradient was associated with lower odds (0.91 [0.86 to 0.97]).
Conclusion
Odds of severe COVID-19 were approximately 25\% lower per standard deviation (‚àº30 min/d) MVPA. A greater proportion of vigorous activity was associated with lower odds of severe and nonsevere infections. The association between total activity and higher odds of a nonsevere infection may be through greater community engagement and thus more exposure to the virus. Results support calls for public health messaging highlighting the potential of MVPA for reducing the odds of severe COVID-19.},

We explored the associations between neighborhood environmental characteristics grouped within five facets (spaces for physical activity, walkability, disturbance, natural environment, and the sociodemographic environment) and objective (‚Äòrecorded‚Äô) and self-reported (‚Äòreported‚Äô) physical activity in adults from UK Biobank. Recorded activity was assessed using wrist-worn accelerometers (2013‚Äì2015, n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ65,967) and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), walking, and walking for pleasure was self-reported (2006‚Äì2010, n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ337,822). Associations were assessed using linear and multinomial logistic regression models and data were analyzed in 2017. We found participants living in areas with higher concentrations of air pollution recorded and reported lower levels of physical activity and those in rural areas and more walkable areas had higher levels of both recorded and reported activity. Some associations varied according to the specificity of the outcome, for example, those living in the most deprived areas were less likely to record higher levels of MVPA (upper tertile: RRR: 0.80 95\% CI: 0.74, 0.86) but were more likely to report higher levels of walking (upper tertile: RRR: 1.09, 95\% CI: 1.06, 1.13). Environmental characteristics have the potential to contribute to different physical activities but interventions which focus on a single environmental attribute or physical activity outcome may not have the greatest benefits.},

	abstract = {Background Wrist-worn accelerometers are emerging as the most common instrument for measuring physical activity in large-scale epidemiological studies, though little is known about the relationship between wrist acceleration and physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE). Methods 1695 UK adults wore two devices simultaneously for six days; a combined sensor and a wrist accelerometer. The combined sensor measured heart rate and trunk acceleration, which was combined with a treadmill test to yield a signal of individually-calibrated PAEE. Multi-level regression models were used to characterise the relationship between the two time-series, and their estimations were evaluated in an independent holdout sample. Finally, the relationship between PAEE and BMI was described separately for each source of PAEE estimate (wrist acceleration models and combined-sensing). Results Wrist acceleration explained 44‚Äì47\% between-individual variance in PAEE, with RMSE between 34‚Äì39 J‚Ä¢min-1‚Ä¢kg-1. Estimations agreed well with PAEE in cross-validation (mean bias [95\% limits of agreement]: 0.07 [-70.6:70.7]) but overestimated in women by 3\% and underestimated in men by 4\%. Estimation error was inversely related to age (-2.3 J‚Ä¢min-1‚Ä¢kg-1 per 10y) and BMI (-0.3 J‚Ä¢min-1‚Ä¢kg-1 per kg/m2). Associations with BMI were similar for all PAEE estimates (approximately -0.08 kg/m2 per J‚Ä¢min-1‚Ä¢kg-1). Conclusions A strong relationship exists between wrist acceleration and PAEE in free-living adults, such that irrespective of the objective method of PAEE assessment, a strong inverse association between PAEE and BMI was observed.},

	abstract = {Physical activity is regarded as favorable to health but effects across the spectrum of human disease are poorly quantified. In contrast to self-reported measures, wearable accelerometers can provide more precise and reproducible activity quantification. Using wrist-worn accelerometry data from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study, we test associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) ‚Äì both total MVPA minutes and whether MVPA is above a guideline-based threshold of ‚â•150‚Äâmin/week‚Äîand incidence of 697 diseases using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, Townsend Deprivation Index, educational attainment, diet quality, alcohol use, blood pressure, anti-hypertensive use. We correct for multiplicity at a false discovery rate of 1\%. We perform analogous testing using self-reported MVPA. Among 96,244 adults wearing accelerometers for one week (age 62 ¬± 8 years), MVPA is associated with 373 (54\%) tested diseases over a median 6.3 years of follow-up. Greater MVPA is overwhelmingly associated with lower disease risk (98\% of associations) with hazard ratios (HRs) ranging 0.70‚Äì0.98 per 150‚Äâmin increase in weekly MVPA, and associations spanning all 16 disease categories tested. Overall, associations with lower disease risk are enriched for cardiac (16\%), digestive (14\%), endocrine/metabolic (10\%), and respiratory conditions (8\%) (chi-square p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.01). Similar patterns are observed using the guideline-based threshold of ‚â•150 MVPA min/week. Some of the strongest associations with guideline-adherent activity include lower risks of incident heart failure (HR 0.65, 95\% CI 0.55‚Äì0.77), type 2 diabetes (HR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.58‚Äì0.71), cholelithiasis (HR 0.61, 95\% CI 0.54‚Äì0.70), and chronic bronchitis (HR 0.42, 95\% CI 0.33‚Äì0.54). When assessed within 456,374 individuals providing self-reported MVPA, effect sizes for guideline-adherent activity are substantially smaller (e.g., heart failure HR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.80‚Äì0.88). Greater wearable device-based physical activity is robustly associated with lower disease incidence. Future studies are warranted to identify potential mechanisms linking physical activity and disease, and assess whether optimization of measured activity can reduce disease risk.},

	abstract = {Background:
Step count is an intuitive measure of physical activity frequently quantified in a range of health-related studies; however, accurate quantification of step count can be difficult in the free-living environment, with step counting error routinely above 20\% in both consumer and research-grade wrist-worn devices. This study aims to describe the development and validation of step count derived from a wrist-worn accelerometer and to assess its association with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in a large prospective cohort study.

Methods:
We developed and externally validated a hybrid step detection model that involves self-supervised machine learning, trained on a new ground truth annotated, free-living step count dataset (OxWalk, n=39, aged 19‚Äì81) and tested against other open-source step counting algorithms. This model was applied to ascertain daily step counts from raw wrist-worn accelerometer data of 75,493 UK Biobank participants without a prior history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cancer. Cox regression was used to obtain hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for the association of daily step count with fatal CVD and all-cause mortality after adjustment for potential confounders.

Findings:
The novel step algorithm demonstrated a mean absolute percent error of 12.5\% in free-living validation, detecting 98.7\% of true steps and substantially outperforming other recent wrist-worn, open-source algorithms. Our data are indicative of an inverse dose-response association, where, for example, taking 6,596 to 8,474 steps per day was associated with a 39\% [24‚Äì52\%] and 27\% [16‚Äì36\%] lower risk of fatal CVD and all-cause mortality, respectively, compared to those taking fewer steps each day.

Interpretation:
An accurate measure of step count was ascertained using a machine learning pipeline that demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in internal and external validation. The expected associations with CVD and all-cause mortality indicate excellent face validity. This algorithm can be used widely for other studies that have utilised wrist-worn accelerometers and an open-source pipeline is provided to facilitate implementation.},

However, some sleep phenotypes are difficult to evaluate without long-term, precise sleep monitoring, for which simple yet accurate sleep measurement is required. To solve this problem, we recently developed a state-of-the-art sleep/wake classification algorithm based on wristband-type accelerometers, termed ACCEL (acceleration-based classification and estimation of long-term sleep-wake cycles). In this study, we optimized and applied ACCEL to large-scale analysis of human sleep phenotypes. The clustering of an about 100,000-arm acceleration dataset in the UK Biobank using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimension reduction and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering methods identified 16 sleep phenotypes, including those related to social jet lag, chronotypes (‚Äúmorning/night person‚Äù), and seven different insomnia-like phenotypes. Considering the complex relationship between sleep disorders and other psychiatric disorders, these unbiased and comprehensive analyses of sleep phenotypes in humans will not only contribute to the advancement of biomedical research on genetic and environmental factors underlying human sleep patterns but also, allow for the development of better digital biomarkers for psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Purpose¬†
          Commonly used physical activity metrics tell us little about the intensity distribution across the activity profile. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a metric, the intensity gradient, which can be used in combination with average acceleration (overall activity level) to fully describe the activity profile.
          Methods¬†
          A total of 1669 adolescent girls (sample 1) and 295 adults with type 2 diabetes (sample 2) wore a GENEActiv accelerometer on their nondominant wrist for up to 7 d. Body mass index and percent body fat were assessed in both samples and physical function (grip strength, Short Physical Performance Battery, and sit-to-stand repetitions) in sample 2. Physical activity metrics were as follows: average acceleration (AccelAV); the intensity gradient (IntensityGRAD from the log‚Äìlog regression line: 25-mg intensity bins [x]/time accumulated in each bin [y]); total moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA); and bouted MVPA (sample 2 only).
          Results¬†
          Correlations between AccelAV and IntensityGRAD (r = 0.39‚Äì0.51) were similar to correlations between AccelAV and bouted MVPA (r = 0.48) and substantially lower than between AccelAV and total MVPA (r ‚â• 0.93). IntensityGRAD was negatively associated with body fatness in sample 1 (P {\textless} 0.05) and positively associated with physical function in sample 2 (P {\textless} 0.05); associations were independent of AccelAV and potential covariates. By contrast, MVPA was not independently associated with body fatness or physical function.
          Conclusion¬†
          AccelAV and IntensityGRAD provide a complementary description of a person‚Äôs activity profile, each explaining unique variance, and independently associated with body fatness and/or physical function. Both metrics are appropriate for reporting as standardized measures and suitable for comparison across studies using raw acceleration accelerometers. Concurrent use will facilitate investigation of the relative importance of intensity and volume of activity for a given outcome.},

Here we show that technical noise produces deviations up to 9 years between replicates for six prominent epigenetic clocks, limiting their utility. We present a computational solution to bolster reliability, calculating principal components (PCs) from CpG-level data as input for biological age prediction. Our retrained PC versions of six clocks show agreement between most replicates within 1.5 years, improved detection of clock associations and intervention effects, and reliable longitudinal trajectories in vivo and in vitro. This method entails only one additional step compared to traditional clocks, requires no replicates or previous knowledge of CpG reliabilities for training, and can be applied to any existing or future epigenetic biomarker. The high reliability of PC-based clocks is critical for applications to personalized medicine, longitudinal tracking, in vitro studies and clinical trials of aging interventions.},

	abstract = {Wearable devices can capture unexplored movement patterns such as brief bursts of vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA) that is embedded into everyday life, rather than being done as leisure time exercise. Here, we examined the association of VILPA with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality in 25,241 nonexercisers (mean age 61.8‚Äâyears, 14,178 women/11,063 men) in the UK Biobank. Over an average follow-up of 6.9‚Äâyears, during which 852 deaths occurred, VILPA was inversely associated with all three of these outcomes in a near-linear fashion. Compared with participants who engaged in no VILPA, participants who engaged in VILPA at the sample median VILPA frequency of 3‚Äâlength-standardized bouts per day (lasting 1 or 2‚Äâmin each) showed a 38\%‚Äì40\% reduction in all-cause and cancer mortality risk and a 48\%‚Äì49\% reduction in CVD mortality risk. Moreover, the sample median VILPA duration of 4.4‚Äâmin per day was associated with a 26\%‚Äì30\% reduction in all-cause and cancer mortality risk and a 32\%‚Äì34\% reduction in CVD mortality risk. We obtained similar results when repeating the above analyses for vigorous physical activity (VPA) in 62,344 UK Biobank participants who exercised (1,552 deaths, 35,290 women/27,054 men). These results indicate that small amounts of vigorous nonexercise physical activity are associated with substantially lower mortality. VILPA in nonexercisers appears to elicit similar effects to VPA in exercisers, suggesting that VILPA may be a suitable physical activity target, especially in people not able or willing to exercise.},

	abstract = {Chronological age is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. Previous findings indicate that epigenetic age could be altered in viral infection. However, the epigenetic aging in COVID-19 has not been well studied. In this study, DNA methylation of the blood samples from 232 healthy individuals and 413 COVID-19 patients is profiled using EPIC methylation array. Epigenetic ages of each individual are determined by applying epigenetic clocks and telomere length estimator to the methylation profile of the individual. Epigenetic age acceleration is calculated and compared between groups. We observe strong correlations between the epigenetic clocks and individual‚Äôs chronological age (r‚Äâ{\textgreater}‚Äâ0.8, p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.0001). We also find the increasing acceleration of epigenetic aging and telomere attrition in the sequential blood samples from healthy individuals and infected patients developing non-severe and severe COVID-19. In addition, the longitudinal DNA methylation profiling analysis find that the accumulation of epigenetic aging from COVID-19 syndrome could be partly reversed at late clinic phases in some patients. In conclusion, accelerated epigenetic aging is associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing severe COVID-19. In addition, the accumulation of epigenetic aging from COVID-19 may contribute to the post-COVID-19 syndrome among survivors.},

	abstract = {A set of core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) includes total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and Œ≤-amyloid 42 (AŒ≤42). These biomarkers reflect some of the key aspects of AD pathophysiology, including neuronal degeneration, tau phosphorylation with tangle formation, and AŒ≤ aggregation with deposition of the peptide into plaques. The core AD CSF biomarkers have been validated clinically in numerous studies, and found to have a very high diagnostic performance to identify AD, both in the dementia and in the mild cognitive impairment stages of the disease. CSF AŒ≤42 has also been found to show very high concordance with amyloid PET to identify brain amyloid deposition. The synaptic protein neurogranin is a novel candidate CSF biomarker for AD and prodromal AD. High CSF neurogranin predicts future cognitive decline and seems to be more specific for AD than, for example, T-tau. Importantly, technical developments have given ultrasensitive measurement techniques that allow measurement of brain-specific proteins such as tau and neurofilament light (NFL) in blood samples. Both plasma tau and NFL are increased in AD, and a recent study showed that plasma NFL has a diagnostic performance comparable to the core AD CSF biomarkers, and predicted future cognitive decline. Future large longitudinal clinical studies are warranted to determine the potential for plasma tau and NFL to serve as first-in-line screening tools for neurodegeneration in primary care.},

	abstract = {Blood biomarkers for dementia have the potential to identify preclinical disease and improve participant selection for clinical trials. Machine learning is an efficient analytical strategy to simultaneously identify multiple candidate biomarkers for dementia. We aimed to identify important candidate blood biomarkers for dementia using three machine learning models. We included 1642 (mean 69 ¬± 6 yr, 53\% women) dementia-free Framingham Offspring Cohort participants attending examination, 7 who had available blood biomarker data. We developed three machine learning models, support vector machine (SVM), eXtreme gradient boosting of decision trees (XGB), and artificial neural network (ANN), to identify candidate biomarkers for incident dementia. Over a mean 12 ¬± 5 yr follow-up, 243 (14.8\%) participants developed dementia. In multivariable models including all 38 available biomarkers, the XGB model demonstrated the strongest predictive accuracy for incident dementia (AUC 0.74 ¬± 0.01), followed by ANN (AUC 0.72 ¬± 0.01), and SVM (AUC 0.69 ¬± 0.01). Stepwise feature elimination by random sampling identified a subset of the nine most highly informative biomarkers. Machine learning models confined to these nine biomarkers showed improved model predictive accuracy for dementia (XGB, AUC 0.76 ¬± 0.01; ANN, AUC 0.75 ¬± 0.004; SVM, AUC 0.73 ¬± 0.01). A parsimonious panel of nine candidate biomarkers were identified which showed moderately good predictive accuracy for incident dementia, although our results require external validation.},

	abstract = {Objective To investigate the association between weight changes across adulthood and mortality.
Design Prospective cohort study.
Setting US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988-94 and 1999-2014.
Participants 36 051 people aged 40 years or over with measured body weight and height at baseline and recalled weight at young adulthood (25 years old) and middle adulthood (10 years before baseline).
Main outcome measures All cause and cause specific mortality from baseline until 31 December 2015.
Results During a mean follow-up of 12.3 years, 10 500 deaths occurred. Compared with participants who remained at normal weight, those moving from the non-obese to obese category between young and middle adulthood had a 22\% (hazard ratio 1.22, 95\% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.33) and 49\% (1.49, 1.21 to 1.83) higher risk of all cause mortality and heart disease mortality, respectively. Changing from obese to non-obese body mass index over this period was not significantly associated with mortality risk. An obese to non-obese weight change pattern from middle to late adulthood was associated with increased risk of all cause mortality (1.30, 1.16 to 1.45) and heart disease mortality (1.48, 1.14 to 1.92), whereas moving from the non-obese to obese category over this period was not significantly associated with mortality risk. Maintaining obesity across adulthood was consistently associated with increased risk of all cause mortality; the hazard ratio was 1.72 (1.52 to 1.95) from young to middle adulthood, 1.61 (1.41 to 1.84) from young to late adulthood, and 1.20 (1.09 to 1.32) from middle to late adulthood. Maximum overweight had a very modest or null association with mortality across adulthood. No significant associations were found between various weight change patterns and cancer mortality.
Conclusions Stable obesity across adulthood, weight gain from young to middle adulthood, and weight loss from middle to late adulthood were associated with increased risks of mortality. The findings imply that maintaining normal weight across adulthood, especially preventing weight gain in early adulthood, is important for preventing premature deaths in later life.},

	abstract = {BackgroundUrban agriculture has been shown to contribute to healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as increased fruit and vegetable intake and greater exposure to greenspaces and there is plenty of evidence linking these lifestyle behaviors to better health and wellbeing. However, most evidence relates to assessing one behavior at a time despite available epidemiological research showing how the combined effects of multiple behaviors are associated with health and wellbeing. This research aims to examine the association of the interactions between various lifestyle behaviors and exposures related to urban agriculture and health and wellbeing.MethodsWe used data from the UK Biobank baseline questionnaire (N{\textasciitilde}500, 000) to assess the association of two lifestyle behaviors (fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity) and greenspace exposure, with four health and wellbeing markers (blood pressure, BMI, self-health assessment, and self-reported loneliness) independently, and in combination. Associations between lifestyle behaviors, greenspace exposure, and the possible interactions with health and wellbeing were explored using general linear models (GLMs), adjusted for socio-demographic confounders including age, sex, educational qualifications, index of multiple deprivation, and ethnicity, and a lifestyle confounder: smoking status.ResultsAfter removing missing data, as well as participants who did not meet the inclusion criteria, the final study sample was n = 204,478. The results indicate that meeting recommended levels of the World Health Organization (WHO) for fruits and vegetable intake, and the advice from the UK Chief Medical Officer for physical activity, is linked to better health and wellbeing markers. We found that UK Biobank participants who lived in greener areas and were physically active were more likely to feel alone and think their health was poor. Participants who were physically active and met the recommended intake of fruits and vegetables were more likely to have healthy blood pressure, feel less lonely, and rate their health as good. Evidence of three-way interactions was weak, and mostly was not associated with the health and wellbeing markers assessed here.ConclusionTaken in combination, healthy diets, physical activity and exposure to greenspaces are associated with health and wellbeing. In some cases, these effects are synergistic, indicating associations above and beyond the mere additive effect of the behaviors considered independently. Promoting such behaviors together, for example, through urban agriculture, is therefore more likely to generate greater public health changes than if they are promoted through independent policies and programs. Inter-relationships between these pathways and different health and wellbeing markers, however, are complex, and require further investigation to understand optimal environments and conditions for urban health promotion.},

To evaluate the association of a healthy

guidelines (no current smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, regular physical

appropriate social connection), with all-cause and cause-specific mortality
among individuals with type 2 diabetes. 



Research Design and
Methods: This study included 13,366 participants with baseline type 2 diabetes
from the UK Biobank free of CVD or cancer. Lifestyle information was collected
through a baseline questionnaire.

Results:
During a median follow-up of 11.7 years, 1,561 deaths were documented, with 625
from cancer, 370 from CVD, 115 from respiratory disease, 81 from digestive
disease, and 74 from neurodegenerative disease. In multivariate-adjusted model, each
lifestyle factor was significantly associated with all-cause mortality and hazard
ratios (95\% CIs) associated with the lifestyle score (scoring 6-7 vs. 0-2
unless specified) were 0.42 (0.34, 0.52) for all-cause mortality, 0.57 (0.41,
0.80) for cancer mortality, 0.35 (0.22, 0.56) for CVD mortality, 0.26 (0.10,
0.63) for respiratory mortality, and 0.28 (0.14, 0.53) for digestive mortality
(scoring 5-7 vs. 0-2). In the population-attributable-risk analysis, 27.1\% (95\%
CI: 16.1, 38.0\%) death was attributable to a poor lifestyle (scoring 0-5). The association between a healthy
lifestyle and all-cause mortality was consistent, irrespective of factors
reflecting diabetes severity (diabetes duration, glycemic
control, diabetes-related microvascular disease, and diabetes medication).



Conclusions:
A
healthy lifestyle was associated with a lower risk of mortality due to
all-cause, CVD, cancer, respiratory disease, and digestive disease among
individuals with type 2 diabetes.},

Quantifying whether such sex differences are also pervasive in wild mammals is a crucial challenge in both evolutionary biology and biogerontology. Here, we compile demographic data from 134 mammal populations, encompassing 101 species, to show that the female‚Äôs median lifespan is on average 18.6\% longer than that of conspecific males, whereas in humans the female advantage is on average 7.8\%. On the contrary, we do not find any consistent sex differences in aging rates. In addition, sex differences in median adult lifespan and aging rates are both highly variable across species. Our analyses suggest that the magnitude of sex differences in mammalian mortality patterns is likely shaped by local environmental conditions in interaction with the sex-specific costs of sexual selection.},

This deterioration is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of aging is controlled, at least to some extent, by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. This review enumerates nine tentative hallmarks that represent common denominators of aging in different organisms, with special emphasis on mammalian aging. These hallmarks are: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient-sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. A major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate hallmarks and their relative contribution to aging, with the final goal of identifying pharmaceutical targets to improve human health during aging with minimal side-effects.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms - near 24‚Äâh intrinsic biological rhythms - modulate many aspects of human physiology and hence disruption of circadian rhythms may have an important impact on human health. Experimental work supports a potential link between irregular circadian rhythms and several key risk factors for cardiovascular disease including hypertension, obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia, collectively termed the metabolic syndrome. While several epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between shift-work and the components of the metabolic syndrome in working-age adults, there is a relative paucity of data concerning the impact of non-occupational circadian irregularity in older women and men. To address this question, we studied 7 days of actigraphic data from 1137 older woman and men participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a community-based cohort study of the chronic conditions of aging. The regularity of activity rhythms was quantified using the nonparametric interdaily stability metric, and was related to the metabolic syndrome and its components obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia. More regular activity rhythms were associated with a lower odds of having the metabolic syndrome (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.69, 95\% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.60-0.80, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ5.8‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10(-7)), being obese (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.73, 95\% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.63-0.85, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.5‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10(-5)), diabetic (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.76, 95\% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.65-0.90, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ9.3‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10(-4)), hypertensive (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.78, 95\% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.66-0.91, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.0‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10(-3)) or dyslipidemic (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.82, 95\% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.72-0.92, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.2‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10(-3)). These associations were independent of differences in objectively measured total daily physical activity or rest, and were not accounted for by prevalent coronary artery disease, stroke or peripheral artery disease. Moreover, more regular activity rhythms were associated with lower odds of having cardiovascular disease (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.83; 95\% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.73-0.95, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ5.7‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10(-3)), an effect that was statistically mediated by the metabolic syndrome. We conclude that irregular activity rhythms are associated with several key components of the metabolic syndrome in older community-dwelling adults, and that the metabolic syndrome statistically partially mediates the association between activity rhythms and prevalent cardiovascular disease. Although additional longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to conclusively delineate the causal relationships underlying these associations, these findings are consistent with preclinical data, and add further support for investigations of the irregularity of activity rhythms as a potential therapeutic target to decrease the burden of cardiovascular disease in older adults.},

To simplify the analysis, we used a log-linear mortality estimate from the CBC variables as a single quantitative measure of the¬†aging process, henceforth referred to as dynamic organism state indicator (DOSI). We observed, that the age-dependent population DOSI distribution broadening could be explained by a progressive loss of physiological resilience measured by the DOSI auto-correlation time. Extrapolation of this trend suggested that DOSI recovery time and variance would simultaneously diverge at a critical point of 120‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ150 years of age corresponding to a complete loss of resilience. The observation was immediately confirmed by the independent analysis of correlation properties of intraday physical activity levels fluctuations collected by wearable devices. We conclude that the criticality resulting in the end of life is an intrinsic biological property of an organism that is independent of stress factors and signifies a fundamental or absolute limit of human lifespan.},

Improvements in public health and medicine are having a profound effect on population demographics worldwide. By 2017, there will be more people over the age of 65 than under age 5, and by 2050, two billion of the estimated nine billion people on Earth will be older than 60 (http://unfpa.org/ageingreport/). Although we can reasonably expect to live longer today than past generations did, the age-related disease burden we will have to confront has not changed. With the proportion of older people among the global population being now higher than at any time in history and still expanding, maintaining health into old age (or healthspan) has become a new and urgent frontier for modern medicine.

It is mediated by the in-phase expression of cell adhesion molecules and chemokines.The response of an organism to acute inflammatory insults exhibits circadian oscillations. This is probably due to the circadian regulation of leukocyte trafficking, of the expression of pathogen-sensitive receptors and of the phagocytic activity of leukocytes.Chronic diseases exhibit circadian exacerbations in their symptoms or presentations, which has been linked to an exaggeration of the circadian expression of pro-inflammatory mediators.Circadian rhythms should be taken into account when harvesting human tissue samples and in experimental settings using preclinical animal models.

	abstract = {Wearable devices are increasingly present in the health context, as tools for biomedical research and clinical care. In this context, wearables are considered key tools for a more digital, personalised, preventive medicine. At the same time, wearables have also been associated with issues and risks, such as those connected to privacy and data sharing. Yet, discussions in the literature have mostly focused on either technical or ethical considerations, framing these as largely separate areas of discussion, and the contribution of wearables to the collection, development, application of biomedical knowledge has only partially been discussed. To fill in these gaps, in this article we provide an epistemic (knowledge-related) overview of the main functions of wearable technology for health: monitoring, screening, detection, and prediction. On this basis, we identify 4 areas of concern in the application of wearables for these functions: data quality, balanced estimations, health equity, and fairness. To move the field forward in an effective and beneficial direction, we present recommendations for the 4 areas: local standards of quality, interoperability, access, and representativity.},

As actigraphic technology continues to evolve, it is important for data analysis to keep pace with new variables and features. Our objective is to study the behavior of two variables, interdaily stability and intradaily variability, to describe rest activity rhythm. Simulated data and actigraphy data of humans, rats, and marmosets were used in this study. We modified the method of calculation for IV and IS by modifying the time intervals of analysis. For each variable, we calculated the average value (IVm and ISm) results for each time interval. Simulated data showed that (1) synchronization analysis depends on sample size, and (2) fragmentation is independent of the amplitude of the generated noise. We were able to obtain a significant difference in the fragmentation patterns of stroke patients using an IVm variable, while the variable IV60 was not identified. Rhythmic synchronization of activity and rest was significantly higher in young than adults with Parkinson◊≥s when using the ISM variable; however, this difference was not seen using IS60. We propose an updated format to calculate rhythmic fragmentation, including two additional optional variables. These alternative methods of nonparametric analysis aim to more precisely detect sleep‚Äìwake cycle fragmentation and synchronization.},

The utilization of wearable devices in quantifying circadian rhythm to elucidate its connection to longevity, through continuously collected data remains largely unstudied. In this work, we investigate a data-driven segmentation of the 24-h accelerometer activity profiles from wearables as a novel digital biomarker for longevity in 7,297 U.S. adults from the 2011‚Äì2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Using hierarchical clustering, we identified five clusters and described them as follows: ‚ÄúHigh activity‚Äù, ‚ÄúLow activity‚Äù, ‚ÄúMild circadian rhythm (CR) disruption‚Äù, ‚ÄúSevere CR disruption‚Äù, and ‚ÄúVery low activity‚Äù. Young adults with extreme CR disturbance are seemingly healthy with few comorbid conditions, but in fact associated with higher white blood cell, neutrophils, and lymphocyte counts (0.05‚Äì0.07 log-unit, all p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.05) and accelerated biological aging (1.42¬†years, p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001). Older adults with CR disruption are significantly associated with increased systemic inflammation indexes (0.09‚Äì0.12 log-unit, all p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.05), biological aging advance (1.28¬†years, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.021), and all-cause mortality risk (HR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.58, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.042). Our findings highlight the importance of circadian alignment on longevity across all ages and suggest that data from wearable accelerometers can help in identifying at-risk populations and personalize treatments for healthier aging.},

Current analytical practice is to summarize each of these three domains individually via a standard inventory of interpretable features, and explore individual associations between the features and clinical variables. However, the features often exhibit significant interaction and correlation both within and between domains. Integration of features across multiple domains remains methodologically challenging. To address this problem, we propose to use joint and individual variation explained, a dimension reduction technique that efficiently deals with multivariate data representing multiple domains. In this paper, we review the most frequently used features to characterize the domains of physical activity, sleep, and circadian rhythmicity and illustrate the approach using wrist-worn actigraphy data from 198 participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.},

Randomly selected members of the English general public completed 10 time trade-off and 7 discrete choice experiment tasks in face-to-face interviews. A 20-parameter hybrid model was used to combine time trade-off and discrete choice experiment data to generate values for the 3,125 EQ-5D-5L health states. Valuation data are available for 996 respondents. Face validity of the data has been demonstrated, with more severe health states generally given lower values. Problems with pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression received the greatest weight. Compared to the existing EQ-5D-3L value set, there are considerably fewer "worse than dead" states (5.1\%, compared with over one third), and the minimum value is higher. Values range from -0.285 (extreme problems on all dimensions) to 0.950 (for health states 11211 and 21111). Results have important implications for users of the EQ-5D-5L both in England and internationally.

However, these instruments are incongruously assessed for their psychometric properties. The National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) uses a generic questionnaire to assess the activities of daily living (ADL) to measure functional limitations among its participants. The psychometric properties of the NHANES-ADL scale were evaluated using a patient examination and survey data. Methods: NHANES-ADL scale was assessed for its internal consistency and factor structure. Scale reliability was assessed with Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient. Principal component analysis with Promax rotation was used to obtain factor structure. Confirmatory factory analysis was used to calculate fit indices. The graded item response theory model was used to estimate item discrimination, difficulty, and test information. Results: Our sample included 1132 individuals with RA. Exploratory factor analyses of 19-item NHANES ADL scale produced one factor solution and accounted for 35\% of variance. The Cronbach alpha of this scale was 0.92. The results of graded item response model indicated items performing well discriminating high and low level of functional ability. A higher slope (Œ±) reflected stronger ability of items to discriminate across the continuum. Conclusions: The NHANES ADL scale showed good reliability, single dimensionality, and validity in RA patients. Studies should explore its test-retest reliability and its ability to reliably measure functional change over time in the future.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Disruption of rest-activity rhythms is cross-sectionally associated with metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, yet it remains unclear whether it predicts impaired glucose metabolism and homeostasis. The aim of this study is to examine the cross-sectional and prospective associations between rest-activity rhythm characteristics and glycemic measures in a cohort of older men.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Baseline rest-activity rhythms were derived from actigraphy with use of extended cosine model analysis. With subjects fasting, glucose, insulin, and HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured from blood at baseline and after ‚àº3.5 years. Type 2 diabetes was defined based on self-report, medication use, and fasting glucose.
RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analysis (n = 2,450), lower 24-h amplitude-to-mesor ratio (i.e., mean activity-adjusted rhythm amplitude) and reduced overall rhythmicity were associated with higher fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (all P trend {\textless} 0.0001), indicating increased insulin resistance. The odds of baseline type 2 diabetes were significantly higher among those in the lowest quartile of amplitude (Q1) (odds ratio [OR]Q1 vs. Q4 1.63 [95\% CI 1.14, 2.30]) and late acrophase group (ORlate vs. normal 1.46 [95\% CI 1.04, 2.04]). In the prospective analysis (n = 861), multiple rest-activity characteristics predicted a two- to threefold increase in type 2 diabetes risk, including a lower amplitude (ORQ1 vs. Q4 3.81 [95\% CI 1.45, 10.00]) and amplitude-to-mesor ratio (OR 2.79 [95\% CI 1.10, 7.07]), reduced overall rhythmicity (OR 3.49 [95\% CI 1.34, 9.10]), and a late acrophase (OR 2.44 [1.09, 5.47]).
CONCLUSIONS: Rest-activity rhythm characteristics are associated with impaired glycemic metabolism and homeostasis and higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To prevent onset of age-related diseases and physical and cognitive decline, interventions to slow human aging and extend health span must eventually be applied to people while they are still young and healthy. Yet most human aging research examines older adults, many with chronic disease, and little is known about aging in healthy young humans.
METHOD: This article explains how this knowledge gap is a barrier to extending health span and puts forward the case that geroscience should invest in researching the pace of aging in young adults. As one illustrative example, we describe an initial effort to study the pace of aging in a young-adult birth cohort by using repeated waves of biomarkers collected across the third and fourth decades to quantify the pace of coordinated physiological deterioration across multiple organ systems (eg, pulmonary, periodontal, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, metabolic, and immune function).
RESULTS: Findings provided proof of principle that it is possible to quantify individual variation in the pace of aging in young adults still free of age-related diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: This article articulates research needs to improve longitudinal measurement of the pace of aging in young people, to pinpoint factors that slow or speed the pace of aging, to compare pace of aging against genomic clocks, to explain slow-aging young adults, and to apply pace of aging in preventive clinical trials of antiaging therapies. This article puts forward a research agenda to fill the knowledge gap concerning lifelong causes of aging.},

The study is designed to examine whether the time of day of physical activity is associated with cardiovascular mortality. We analyzed 94,489 UK Biobank adults with objectively measured physical activity, including 53,328 morning-type participants and 30,962 evening-type participants based on self-reported chronotypes. The time of day of peak physical activity was categorized using a machine learning algorithm: early morning (n¬†=¬†18,477), late morning (n¬†=¬†25,700), midday (reference) (n¬†=¬†27,803), and night (n¬†=¬†22,509). Hazard ratios of cardiovascular mortality were examined using the Cox proportional hazards model. During a median follow-up of 6.9¬†years (interquartile range, 6.3‚Äì7.4¬†years), we identified 629 cardiovascular deaths. The hazard of cardiovascular mortality was elevated in the early morning group (hazard ratio¬†=¬†1.56, 95\% Confidence Interval [1.23‚Äì1.98]) and night group (1.49, [1.18‚Äì1.88]) but not in the late morning group (1.21, [0.98‚Äì1.47]) compared to the referent midday group. In the chronotype-stratified analysis, the increased cardiovascular mortality in the morning group was only observed in the evening-type participants, while the increased cardiovascular mortality in the night group was only observed in the morning-type participants. In conclusion, optimizing the timing of peak physical activity according to cardiovascular circadian rhythms and individual chronotypes could be a potential therapeutic target that brings additional health benefits.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a difference in physical activity assessment between a wrist-worn accelerometer at the dominant or non-dominant arm. The secondary purpose was to assess the concurrent validity of measures of physical activity from the wrist-worn accelerometer and the waist-worn accelerometer. Forty adults wore three accelerometers simultaneously, one on the waist and one each on the non-dominant wrist and dominant wrist, respectively, for 24 consecutive hours of free-living conditions. Data were uploaded from the monitor to a computer following a 1-day test period. There were no significant differences in physical activity when comparing the dominant versus the non-dominant wrist, regardless of axis (P{\textgreater}0¬∑05). Mean daily accelerometer output data from both wrists were strongly correlated with average counts per minute from the ActiGraph worn around the waist (r = 0¬∑88, P{\textless}0¬∑001). Findings suggest that the choice to wear the accelerometer on the non-dominant or dominant wrist has no impact on results. Data from this study contribute to the knowledge of how to best assess physical activity habits.},

However, it is not always clear whether insights derived from studies in patient populations or in controlled trial settings are transferable to individuals in the general population. To address this issue, a longitudinal analysis was conducted on blood biomarker data from 1032 generally healthy individuals who used an automated, web-based personalized nutrition and lifestyle platform. The study had two main aims: to analyze correlations between biomarkers for biological insights, and to characterize the effectiveness of the platform in improving biomarker levels. First, a biomarker correlation network was constructed to generate biological hypotheses that are relevant to researchers and, potentially, to users of personalized wellness tools. The correlation network revealed expected patterns, such as the established relationships between blood lipid levels, as well as novel insights, such as a connection between neutrophil and triglyceride concentrations that has been suggested as a relevant indicator of cardiovascular risk. Next, biomarker changes during platform use were assessed, showing a trend toward normalcy for most biomarkers in those participants whose values were out of the clinically normal range at baseline. Finally, associations were found between the selection of specific interventions and corresponding biomarker changes, suggesting directions for future study.},

However, recent in¬†vitro studies have raised the possibility of age reversal. Here, we report that biological age is fluid and exhibits rapid changes in both directions. At epigenetic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic levels, we find that the biological age of young mice is increased by heterochronic parabiosis and restored following surgical detachment. We also identify transient changes in biological age during major surgery, pregnancy, and severe COVID-19 in humans and/or mice. Together, these data show that biological age undergoes a rapid increase in response to diverse forms of stress, which is reversed following recovery from stress. Our study uncovers a new layer of aging dynamics that should be considered in future studies.

Two different wrist-worn actigraphy devices were used to measure physical activities. This required data pre-processing and transformations to smooth the differences between devices. Statistical, power spectrum, fractal and entropy analyses were used to derive features from the actigraphy data. Sleep parameters were also extracted from the signals. The features were then submitted to four machine learning algorithms. The best performing model was able to distinguish acute from chronic insomnia with an accuracy of 81\%. The algorithms were then used to evaluate the acute and chronic groups compared to healthy sleepers. The differences between acute insomnia and healthy sleep were more prominent than between chronic insomnia and healthy sleep. This may be associated with the adaptation of the physiology to prolonged periods of disturbed sleep for individuals with chronic insomnia. The new model is a powerful addition to our suite of machine learning models aiming to pre-screen insomnia at home with wearable devices.},

Wearable devices such as Fitbit wristbands enable long-term and non-intrusive monitoring of patients outside clinical environments. To build accurate predictive models based on wearable data, however, requires effective feature engineering to extract high-level features from time series data collected by the wearable sensors. This paper presents a pipeline for developing clinical predictive models based on wearable sensors. The core of the pipeline is a multi-level feature engineering framework for extracting high-level features from fine-grained time series data. The framework integrates a set of techniques tailored for noisy and incomplete wearable data collected in real-world clinical studies: (1) singular spectrum analysis for extracting high-level features from daily features over the course of the study; (2) a set of daily features that are resilient to missing data in wearable time series data; (3) a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method for imputing short missing heart rate segments; (4) the integration of patients' clinical characteristics and wearable features. We evaluated the feature engineering approach and machine learning models in a clinical study involving 61 patients undergoing pancreatic surgery. Linear support vector machine (SVM) with integrated feature engineering achieved an AUROC of 0.8802 for predicting post-operative readmission or severe complications, which significantly outperformed the existing rule-based model used in clinical practice and other state-of-the-art feature engineering approaches.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms become less dominant and less regular with chronic-degenerative disease, such that to accurately assess these pathological conditions it is important to quantify not only periodic characteristics but also more irregular aspects of the corresponding time series. Novel data-adaptive techniques, such as singular spectrum analysis (SSA), allow for the decomposition of experimental time series, in a model-free way, into a trend, quasiperiodic components and noise fluctuations. We compared SSA with the traditional techniques of cosinor analysis and intradaily variability using 1-week continuous actigraphy data in young adults with acute insomnia and healthy age-matched controls. The findings suggest a small but significant delay in circadian components in the subjects with acute insomnia, i.e. a larger acrophase, and alterations in the day-to-day variability of acrophase and amplitude. The power of the ultradian components follows a fractal 1/f power law for controls, whereas for those with acute insomnia this power law breaks down because of an increased variability at the 90min time scale, reminiscent of Kleitman‚Äôs basic rest-activity (BRAC) cycles. This suggests that for healthy sleepers attention and activity can be sustained at whatever time scale required by circumstances, whereas for those with acute insomnia this capacity may be impaired and these individuals need to rest or switch activities in order to stay focused. Traditional methods of circadian rhythm analysis are unable to detect the more subtle effects of day-to-day variability and ultradian rhythm fragmentation at the specific 90min time scale.},

	abstract = {Wearable temperature sensors offer the potential to overcome several limitations associated with current laboratory- and field-based methods for core temperature assessment; however, their ability to provide accurate data at elevated core temperatures (Tc) has been questioned. Therefore, this investigation aimed to determine the concurrent validity of a wearable temperature sensor (CORE) compared to a reference telemetric temperature pill (BodyCAP) during a team-sport heat training camp prior to the 2020 Olympic Games. Female field hockey players (n = 19) in the Australian national squad completed 4 sessions in hot conditions where their temperature was monitored via CORE and BodyCAP. Concurrent validity of the wearable CORE device was determined with reference to the ingested BodyCAP pill. Lin‚Äôs Concordance Correlation Coefficients determined there was ‚Äúpoor‚Äù agreement between devices during all sessions. Mean bias demonstrated that CORE underestimated Tc in all sessions (‚àí0.06¬∞C to ‚àí0.34¬∞C), with wide mean 95\% confidence intervals (¬±0.35¬∞C to ¬±0.56¬∞C). Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing regression lines illustrated a non-linearity of error, with greater underestimation of Tc by the CORE device, as Tc increased. The two devices disagreed more than ¬±0.3¬∞C for 41-60\% of all data samples in each session. Our findings do not support the use of the CORE device as a valid alternative to telemetric temperature pills for Tc assessment, particularly during exercise in hot conditions where elevated Tc are expected. The CORE wearable sensor is not a valid alternative to telemetric temperature pills for Tc assessment, particularly during exercise in hot conditions where elevated Tc are expected.Compared to reference Tc data provided by a validated, ingestible telemetric temperature pill, the CORE device demonstrated ‚Äúpoor‚Äù agreement between devices during all sessions in this investigation.There was a non-linear bias which tended to underestimate Tc to a greater extent as Tc increased (but with wide confidence intervals), with 41-60\% of all data exceeding a threshold error of ¬±0.3¬∞C.},

Its use has historically been focused on single modal data. Attempts to improve prediction and mimic the multimodal nature of clinical expert decision-making has been met in the biomedical field of machine learning by fusing disparate data. This review was conducted to summarize the current studies in this field and identify topics ripe for future research. We conducted this review in accordance with the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews to characterize multi-modal data fusion in health. Search strings were established and used in databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEEXplore from 2011 to 2021. A final set of 128 articles were included in the analysis. The most common health areas utilizing multi-modal methods were neurology and oncology. Early fusion was the most common data merging strategy. Notably, there was an improvement in predictive performance when using data fusion. Lacking from the papers were clear clinical deployment strategies, FDA-approval, and analysis of how using multimodal approaches from diverse sub-populations may improve biases and healthcare disparities. These findings provide a summary on multimodal data fusion as applied to health diagnosis/prognosis problems. Few papers compared the outputs of a multimodal approach with a unimodal prediction. However, those that did achieved an average increase of 6.4\% in predictive accuracy. Multi-modal machine learning, while more robust in its estimations over unimodal methods, has drawbacks in its scalability and the time-consuming nature of information concatenation.},

Continuous real-time monitoring of lifestyle and environmental factors is implemented by integrating wearable devices, open environmental data, indoor air quality sensing devices, a location-based smartphone app, and an AI-assisted telecare platform. The AI-assisted telecare platform provided comprehensive insight into patients' clinical, lifestyle, and environmental data, and generated reliable predictions of future acute exacerbation events. All data from 1,667 patients were collected prospectively during a 24-month follow-up period, resulting in the detection of 386 abnormal episodes. Machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms were used to train modular chronic disease models. The modular chronic disease prediction models that have passed external validation include obesity, panic disorder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with an average accuracy of 88.46\%, a sensitivity of 75.6\%, a specificity of 93.0\%, and an F1 score of 79.8\%. Compared with previous studies, we establish an effective way to collect lifestyle, life trajectory, and symptom records, as well as environmental factors, and improve the performance of the prediction model by adding objective comprehensive data and feature selection. Our results also demonstrate that lifestyle and environmental factors are highly correlated with patient health and have the potential to predict future abnormal events better than using only questionnaire data. Furthermore, we have constructed a cost-effective model that needs only a few features to support the prediction task, which is helpful for deploying real-world modular prediction models.},

	abstract = {Introduction Precision health is a nascent field of research that would benefit from clearer operationalisation and distinction from adjacent fields like precision medicine. This clarification is necessary to enable precision health science to tackle some of the most complex and significant health problems that are faced globally. There is a pressing need to examine the progress in human precision health research in the past 10 years and analyse this data to first, find similarities and determine discordances in how precision health is operationalised in the literature and second, identify gaps and future directions for precision health research.
Methods and analysis To define precision health and map research in this field, a scoping review will be undertaken and reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses - Scoping Review Extension guidelines. Systematic searches of scientific databases (Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO) and grey literature sources (Google Scholar, Google Patents) identified 8053 potentially eligible articles published from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2020. Following removal of duplicates, a total of 3190 articles were imported for screening. Article data will be extracted using a customised extraction template on Covidence and analysed descriptively using narrative synthesis.
Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required. Findings will be disseminated through professional networks, conference presentations and publication in a scientific journal.},

	abstract = {Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of infant mortality globally. Research has focused on developing predictive models for PTB without prioritizing cost-effective interventions. Physical activity and sleep present unique opportunities for interventions in low- and middle-income populations (LMICs). However, objective measurement of physical activity and sleep remains challenging and self-reported metrics suffer from low-resolution and accuracy. In this study, we use physical activity data collected using a wearable device comprising over 181,944‚Äâh of data across N‚Äâ=‚Äâ1083 patients. Using a new state-of-the art deep learning time-series classification architecture, we develop a ‚Äòclock‚Äô of healthy dynamics during pregnancy by using gestational age (GA) as a surrogate for progression of pregnancy. We also develop novel interpretability algorithms that integrate unsupervised clustering, model error analysis, feature attribution, and automated actigraphy analysis, allowing for model interpretation with respect to sleep, activity, and clinical variables. Our model performs significantly better than 7 other machine learning and AI methods for modeling the progression of pregnancy. We found that deviations from a normal ‚Äòclock‚Äô of physical activity and sleep changes during pregnancy are strongly associated with pregnancy outcomes. When our model underestimates GA, there are 0.52 fewer preterm births than expected (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.01e‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ67, permutation test) and when our model overestimates GA, there are 1.44 times (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.82e‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ39, permutation test) more preterm births than expected. Model error is negatively correlated with interdaily stability (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.043, Spearman‚Äôs), indicating that our model assigns a more advanced GA when an individual‚Äôs daily rhythms are less precise. Supporting this, our model attributes higher importance to sleep periods in predicting higher-than-actual GA, relative to lower-than-actual GA (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.01e‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ21, Mann-Whitney U). Combining prediction and interpretability allows us to signal when activity behaviors alter the likelihood of preterm birth and advocates for the development of clinical decision support through passive monitoring and exercise habit and sleep recommendations, which can be easily implemented in LMICs.},

However, there is a natural decline in physical activity associated with the aging process. Establishing normative trends of physical activity in aging populations is essential to developing public health guidelines and informing clinical perspectives regarding individuals' levels of physical activity. Beyond overall quantity of physical activity, patterns regarding the timing of activity provide additional insights into latent health status. Wearable accelerometers, paired with statistical methods from functional data analysis, provide the means to estimate diurnal patterns in physical activity. To date, these methods have been only applied to study aging trends in populations based in the United States. Here, we apply curve registration and functional regression to 24 h activity profiles for 88,793 men (N = 39,255) and women (N = 49,538) ages 42-78 from the UK Biobank accelerometer study to understand how physical activity patterns vary across ages and by gender. Our analysis finds that daily patterns in both the volume of physical activity and probability of being active change with age, and that there are marked gender differences in these trends. This work represents the largest-ever population analyzed using tools of this kind, and suggest that aging trends in physical activity are reproducible in different populations across countries.},

	abstract = {Human daily activity recognition (HDAR) using wearable sensors is an important task for researchers aiming to develop an effective and feasible model which is capable of accurately detecting human motion patterns. These applications provide elderly care, surveillance systems, and wellness tracking. Despite the pervasive use, recognition and monitoring of human physical activities remains inaccurate, which may contribute to negative reactions and feedback. This paper addresses a data-driven approach to recognizing human daily activities in an indoor-outdoor environment. To improve the classification and recognition of human life-log activities (for example, walking, drinking, and exercising), a model is introduced that incorporates pre-processing (such as denoising), hybrid features extraction from four domains, including time, frequency, wavelet, and time-frequency respectively. After that, stochastic gradient descent is exploited to optimize the selected features. The optimal extracted features are advanced to random forest classifiers in order to develop adaptive for human life-log activities. Additionally, the proposed HDAR model is experimentally evaluated on three benchmark datasets, namely, USC-HAD, which is comprised of 12 physical activities, IM-WSHA, which involves 11 life-log activities, and MOTIONSENSE which contains six static and dynamic activities, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed HDAR method significantly achieves better results and outperforms others in terms of recognition rates of 91.08\%, 91.45\%, and 93.16\% respectively, when the USC-HAD, IM-WSHA, and MOTIONSENE databases are applied.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are crucial for regulating physiological and behavioral processes. Pineal hormone melatonin is often used to measure circadian amplitude but its collection is costly and time-consuming. Wearable activity data are promising alternative, but the most commonly used measure, relative amplitude, is subject to behavioral masking. In this study, we firstly derive a feature named circadian activity rhythm energy (CARE) to better characterize circadian amplitude and validate CARE by correlating it with melatonin amplitude (Pearson‚Äôs r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.46, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.007) among 33 healthy participants. Then we investigate its association with cognitive functions in an adolescent dataset (Chinese SCHEDULE-A, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1703) and an adult dataset (UK Biobank, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ92,202), and find that CARE is significantly associated with Global Executive Composite (Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ30.86, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.016) in adolescents, and reasoning ability, short-term memory, and prospective memory (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01, 3.42, and 11.47 respectively, all P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001) in adults. Finally, we identify one genetic locus with 126 CARE-associated SNPs using the genome-wide association study, of which 109 variants are used as instrumental variables in the Mendelian Randomization analysis, and the results show a significant causal effect of CARE on reasoning ability, short-term memory, and prospective memory (Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ-59.91, 7.94, and 16.85 respectively, all P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.0001). The present study suggests that CARE is an effective wearable-based metric of circadian amplitude with a strong genetic basis and clinical significance, and its adoption can facilitate future circadian studies and potential intervention strategies to improve circadian rhythms and cognitive functions.},

	abstract = {Patients with atopic dermatitis experience increased nocturnal pruritus which leads to scratching and sleep disturbances that significantly contribute to poor quality of life. Objective measurements of nighttime scratching and sleep quantity can help assess the efficacy of an intervention. Wearable sensors can provide novel, objective measures of nighttime scratching and sleep; however, many current approaches were not designed for passive, unsupervised monitoring during daily life. In this work, we present the development and analytical validation of a method that sequentially processes epochs of sample-level accelerometer data from a wrist-worn device to provide continuous digital measures of nighttime scratching and sleep quantity. This approach uses heuristic and machine learning algorithms in a hierarchical paradigm by first determining when the patient intends to sleep, then detecting sleep‚Äìwake states along with scratching episodes, and lastly deriving objective measures of both sleep and scratch. Leveraging reference data collected in a sleep laboratory (NCT ID: NCT03490877), results show that sensor-derived measures of total sleep opportunity (TSO; time when patient intends to sleep) and total sleep time (TST) correlate well with reference polysomnography data (TSO: r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.72, p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001; TST: r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.76, p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001; N‚Äâ=‚Äâ32). Log transformed sensor derived measures of total scratching duration achieve strong agreement with reference annotated video recordings (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.82, p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001; N‚Äâ=‚Äâ25).

Technological advances in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices introduce a potential tool to expand our understanding of glucose control and variability in people with and without diabetes. Yet CGM data have not been characterized in large-scale healthy cohorts, creating a lack of reference for CGM data research. Here we present CGMap, a characterization of CGM data collected from over 7,000 non-diabetic individuals, aged 40‚Äì70 years, between 2019 and 2022. We provide reference values of key CGM-derived clinical measures that can serve as a tool for future CGM research. We further explored the relationship between CGM-derived measures and diabetes-related clinical parameters, uncovering several significant relationships, including associations of mean blood glucose with measures from fundus imaging and sleep monitoring. These findings offer novel research directions for understanding the influence of glucose levels on various aspects of human health.},

Compared with polysomnography (PSG), ambulatory sleep study devices offer the possibility of an accurate diagnosis with convenience and low cost.To assess the correlation between sleep indexes measured by a portable sleep-testing device (peripheral arterial tonometry [PAT]) and those measured by PSG.We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Trial Registry (through May 2013), and relevant article bibliographies. Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing correlation of sleep indexes between PAT devices and PSG in adults (aged \&gt;18 years). Included studies provided a bivariate correlation coefficient for sleep indexes, specifically the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and oxygen desaturation index (ODI).Included studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Reported correlation values for the RDI, AHI, and ODI between a commercially available PAT device (WatchPAT) and PSG were systematically reviewed. A comprehensive meta-analysis software package was used for statistical analysis.Assessment of the correlation between PAT and PSG as measured by AHI, RDI, and ODI. Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria and had data suitable for pooling (909 patients). Of these, 13 studies had blinded study designs, with PAT and PSG conducted simultaneously in the home or the laboratory setting. One study contained 2 trial phases for the same patient group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ29), one laboratory based and the other home based, which were analyzed separately. One study contained 2 different study groups based on age. Overall, correlation of the RDI and AHI was high (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.889 [95\% CI, 0.862-0.911]; P‚Äâ\&lt;‚Äâ.001). Studies comparing the RDI between PAT and PSG had a combined correlation of 0.879 (95\% CI, 0.849-0.904; P‚Äâ\&lt;‚Äâ.001); those comparing the AHI, 0.893 (0.857-0.920; P‚Äâ\&lt;‚Äâ.001); and those comparing the ODI,‚Äâ0.942 (0.894-0.969; P‚Äâ\&lt;‚Äâ.001). Analysis of publication bias revealed a nonsignificant Egger regression intercept.Respiratory indexes calculated using PAT-based portable devices positively correlated with those calculated from the scoring of PSG. Strengthened by the blinded design of most of the included studies, this technology represents a viable alternative to PSG for confirmation of clinically suspected sleep apnea.},

	abstract = {One of the main reasons for fatal accidents on the road is distracted driving. The continuous attention of an individual driver is a necessity for the task of driving. While driving, certain levels of distraction can cause drivers to lose their attention, which might lead to an accident. Thus, the number of accidents can be reduced by early detection of distraction. Many studies have been conducted to automatically detect driver distraction. Although camera-based techniques have been successfully employed to characterize driver distraction, the risk of privacy violation is high. On the other hand, physiological signals have shown to be a privacy preserving and reliable indicator of driver state, while the acquisition technology might be intrusive to drivers in practical implementation. In this study, we investigate a continuous measure of phasic Galvanic Skin Responses (GSR) using a wristband wearable to identify distraction of drivers during a driving experiment on-the-road. We first decompose the raw GSR signal into its phasic and tonic components using Continuous Decomposition Analysis (CDA), and then the continuous phasic component containing relevant characteristics of the skin conductance signals is investigated for further analysis. We generated a high resolution spectro-temporal transformation of the GSR signals for non-distracted and distracted (calling and texting) scenarios to visualize the associated behavior of the decomposed phasic GSR signal in correlation with distracted scenarios. According to the spectrogram observations, we extract relevant spectral and temporal features to capture the patterns associated with the distracted scenarios at the physiological level. We then performed feature selection using support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) in order to: (1) generate a rank of the distinguishing features among the subject population, and (2) create a reduced feature subset toward more efficient distraction identification on the edge at the generalization phase. We employed support vector machine (SVM) to generate the 10-fold cross validation (10-CV) identification performance measures. Our experimental results demonstrated cross-validation accuracy of 94.81\% using all the features and the accuracy of 93.01\% using reduced feature space. The SVM-RFE selected set of features generated a marginal decrease in accuracy while reducing the redundancy in the input feature space toward shorter response time necessary for early notification of distracted state of the driver.},

Cosinor regression shows circadian rhythmicity in 25\% of lipids in both groups. On average, the older group has a {\textasciitilde}14\% lower amplitude and a {\textasciitilde}2.1‚Äâh earlier acrophase of the lipid circadian rhythms (both, p‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ0.001). Additionally, more rhythmic circadian lipids have a significant linear component in addition to the sinusoidal across the 27-h CR in the older group (44/56) compared to the younger group (18/58, p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.0001). Results from individual-level data are consistent with group-average results. Results indicate that prevalence of endogenous circadian rhythms of the human plasma lipidome is preserved with healthy aging into middle-age, but significant changes in rhythmicity include a reduction in amplitude, earlier acrophase, and an altered temporal relationship between central and lipid rhythms.},

Existing approaches for analyzing diurnal patterns using these data, including the cosinor model and functional principal components analysis, have revealed and quantified population-level diurnal patterns, but considerable subject-level variability remained uncaptured in features such as wake/sleep times and activity intensity. This remaining informative variability could provide a better understanding of chronotypes, or behavioral manifestations of one's underlying 24-hour rhythm. Curve registration, or alignment, is a technique in functional data analysis that separates "vertical" variability in activity intensity from "horizontal" variability in time-dependent markers like wake and sleep times; this data-driven approach is well-suited to studying chronotypes using accelerometer data. We develop a parametric registration framework for 24-hour accelerometric rest-activity profiles represented as dichotomized into epoch-level states of activity or rest. Specifically, we estimate subject-specific piecewise linear time-warping functions parametrized with a small set of parameters. We apply this method to data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and illustrate how estimated parameters give a more flexible quantification of chronotypes compared to traditional approaches.},

Instead of using day-level summary statistics to assess these densely sampled inputs, we implement functional principal component analysis (FPCA) approaches to study the temporal patterns of PA data from 245 overweight/obese women at three visits over a 1-year period. We apply longitudinal FPCA to decompose PA inputs, incorporating subject-specific variability, and then test the association between these patterns and obesity-related health outcomes by multiple mixed effect regression models. With the proposed methods, the longitudinal patterns in both densely sampled inputs and scalar outcomes are investigated and connected. The results show that the health outcomes are strongly associated with PA variation, in both subject and visit-level. In addition, we reveal that timing of PA during the day can impact changes in outcomes, a finding that would not be possible with day-level PA summaries. Thus, our findings imply that the use of longitudinal FPCA can elucidate temporal patterns of multiple levels of PA inputs. Furthermore, the exploration of the relationship between PA patterns and health outcomes can be useful for establishing weight-loss guidelines.},

We estimated prospective associations of travel modes with total PA, sedentary time (ST), light-intensity PA (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) among adults aged 39-70‚Äâyears.
METHODS: We studied 90‚Äâ810 UK Biobank participants (56.1‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ7.8‚Äâyears). Driving status, specific travel modes (non-work travel; commuting to/from work) and covariates were assessed by questionnaire (2006-10). PA was assessed over 7‚Äâdays by wrist-worn accelerometers (2013-15). We estimated associations using overall and age-stratified multivariable linear-regression models.
RESULTS: Drivers accumulated 1.4\% more total PA (95\% confidence interval: 0.9, 1.9), 11.2‚Äâmin/day less ST (-12.9, -9.5), 12.2‚Äâmin/day more LPA (11.0, 13.3) and 0.9‚Äâmin/day less MVPA (-1.6, -0.2) than non-drivers. Compared with car/motor-vehicle users, cyclists and walkers had the most optimal activity profiles followed by mixed-mode users (e.g. for non-work travel, cyclists: 10.7\% more total PA, 9.0, 12.4; 20.5‚Äâmin/day less ST, -26.0, -15.0; 14.5‚Äâmin/day more MVPA, 12.0, 17.2; walkers: 4.2\% more total PA, 3.5, 5.0; 7.5‚Äâmin/day less ST -10.2, -4.9; 10.1‚Äâmin/day more MVPA, 8.9, 11.3; mixed-mode users: 2.3\% more total PA, 1.9, 2.7; 3.4‚Äâmin/day less ST -4.8, -2.1; 4.9‚Äâmin/day more MVPA, 4.3, 5.5). Some associations varied by age (p interaction‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.05), but these differences appeared small.
CONCLUSIONS: Assessing specific travel modes rather than driving status alone may better capture variations in activity. Walking, cycling and, to a lesser degree, mixed-mode use are associated with more optimal activity profiles in adults of all ages.},

The objective of this study was to compare the physical activity of those with chronic diseases to healthy individuals using an objective measure of physical activity.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 96‚Äâ706 participants aged 40‚Äâyears or older from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study (2006-10). Diagnoses were identified through ICD 9 and 10 coding within hospital admission records and a cancer registry linked to UK Biobank participants.

Statistical analyses included computation of adjusted geometric means and means using general linear models.
RESULTS: Participants with chronic disease undertook 9\% or 61‚Äâminutes (95\% confidence interval: 57.8-64.8) less moderate activity and 11\% or 3‚Äâminutes (95\% confidence interval: 2.7-3.3) less vigorous activity per week than individuals without chronic disease. Participants in every chronic-disease subgroup undertook less physical activity than those without chronic disease. Sixty-seven diagnoses within these subgroups were associated with lower moderate activity.
CONCLUSIONS: The cross-sectional association of physical activity with chronic disease is broad. Given the substantial health benefits of being physically active, clinicians and policymakers should be aware that their patients with any chronic disease are at greater health risk from other diseases than anticipated because of their physical inactivity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort study containing accelerometer-based physical activity data with strong validity collected from 100,000 participants approximately 5‚Äâyears after baseline. In contrast, the main cohort has multiple self-reported physical behaviours from {\textgreater}‚Äâ500,000 participants with longer follow-up time, offering several epidemiological advantages. However, questionnaire methods typically suffer from greater measurement error, and at present there is no tested method for combining these diverse self-reported data to more comprehensively assess the overall dose of physical activity. This study aimed to use the accelerometry sub-cohort to calibrate the self-reported behavioural variables to produce a harmonised estimate of physical activity energy expenditure, and subsequently examine its reliability, validity, and associations with disease outcomes.
METHODS: We calibrated 14 self-reported behavioural variables from the UK Biobank main cohort using the wrist accelerometry sub-cohort (n¬†=‚Äâ93,425), and used published equations to estimate physical activity energy expenditure (PAEESR). For comparison, we estimated physical activity based on the scoring criteria of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and by summing variables for occupational and leisure-time physical activity with no calibration. Test-retest reliability was assessed using data from the UK Biobank repeat assessment (n¬†=‚Äâ18,905) collected a mean of 4.3‚Äâyears after baseline. Validity was assessed in an independent validation study (n¬†=‚Äâ98) with estimates based on doubly labelled water (PAEEDLW). In the main UK Biobank cohort (n¬†=‚Äâ374,352), Cox regression was used to estimate associations between PAEESR and fatal and non-fatal outcomes including all-cause, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and cancers.
RESULTS: PAEESR explained 27\% variance in gold-standard PAEEDLW estimates, with no mean bias. However, error was strongly correlated with PAEEDLW (r¬†=‚Äâ-.98; p¬†{\textless}‚Äâ0.001), and PAEESR had narrower range than the criterion. Test-retest reliability (Œõ‚Äâ=‚Äâ.67) and relative validity (Spearman‚Äâ=‚Äâ.52) of PAEESR outperformed two common approaches for processing self-report data with no calibration. Predictive validity was demonstrated by associations with morbidity and mortality, e.g. 14\% (95\%CI: 11-17\%) lower mortality for individuals meeting lower physical activity guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: The PAEESR variable has good reliability and validity for ranking individuals, with no mean bias but correlated error at individual-level. PAEESR outperformed uncalibrated estimates and showed stronger inverse associations with disease outcomes.},

Data from these devices are often used to summarise such activity in terms of averages, variances, exceedances, and patterns within a profile. In this study, we report the development of a clustering utilising the whole activity profile. This was achieved using the robust clustering technique of k-medoids applied to an extensive data set of over 90,000 activity profiles, collected as part of the UK Biobank study. We identified nine distinct activity profiles in these data, which captured both the pattern of activity throughout a week and the intensity of the activity: ‚ÄúActive 9 to 5‚Äù, ‚ÄúActive‚Äù, ‚ÄúMorning Movers‚Äù, ‚ÄúGet up and Active‚Äù, ‚ÄúLive for the Weekend‚Äù, ‚ÄúModerates‚Äù, ‚ÄúLeisurely 9 to 5‚Äù, ‚ÄúSedate‚Äù and ‚ÄúInactive‚Äù. These patterns are differentiated by sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and health and circadian rhythm data collected by UK Biobank. The utility of these findings are that they sit alongside existing summary measures of physical activity to provide a way to typify distinct activity patterns that may help to explain other health and morbidity outcomes, e.g., BMI or COVID-19. This research will be returned to the UK Biobank for other researchers to use.},

Using data from 85,760 individuals with activity-monitor derived measures of sleep timing we find that the chronotype loci associate with sleep timing: the mean sleep timing of the 5\% of individuals carrying the most morningness alleles is 25‚Äâmin earlier than the 5\% carrying the fewest. The loci are enriched for genes involved in circadian regulation, cAMP, glutamate and insulin signalling pathways, and those expressed in the retina, hindbrain, hypothalamus, and pituitary. Using Mendelian Randomisation, we show that being a morning person is causally associated with better mental health but does not affect BMI or risk of Type 2 diabetes.

A massive smart card transaction dataset is used to analyze the daily number of passengers for each station in Seoul Metro. First, we cluster the stations into six categories with respect to their patterns of passenger transport. Then, we forecast the daily number of passengers with respect to each cluster. By comparing our predicted results with the actual number of passengers, we demonstrate the predicted number of passengers based on the clustering results is more accurate in contrast to the result without considering the regional properties. The result from our data-driven approach can be applied to improve the subway service plan and relieve infectious diseases as we can reduce the congestion by controlling train intervals based on the passenger flow. Furthermore, the prediction result can be utilized to plan a ‚Äòsmart city‚Äô which seeks shorter commuting time, comfortable ridership, and environmental sustainability.},

This provides the opportunity for the development of mathematical models to analyse and forecast temporal T c changes across populations of subjects. Such models can reduce the need for invasive methods that continuously measure T c. This current work sought to develop a nonlinear mixed effects modelling framework to delineate the dynamic changes of T c and its association with a set of covariates of interest (e.g. heart rate, chest skin temperature), and the structure of the variability of T c in various longitudinal studies. Data to train and evaluate the model were derived from two laboratory investigations involving male soldiers who participated in either a 12 (N‚Äâ‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚Äâ18) or 15 km (N‚Äâ‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚Äâ16) foot march with varied clothing, load and heat acclimatisation status. Model qualification was conducted using nonparametric bootstrap and cross validation procedures. For cross validation, the trajectory of a new subject's T c was simulated via Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimation when using only the baseline T c or using the baseline T c as well as measured T c at the end of every work (march) phase. The final model described T c versus time profiles using a parametric function with its main parameters modelled as a sigmoid hyperbolic function of the load and/or chest skin temperature. Overall, T c predictions corresponded well with the measured data (root mean square deviation: 0.16 ¬∞C), and compared favourably with those provided by two recently published Kalman filter models.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This paper investigates the relationship between core temperature (T c), skin temperature (T s) and heat flux (HF) during exercise in hot conditions.
METHOD: Nine test volunteers, wearing an Army Combat Uniform and body armor, participated in three sessions at 25 ¬∞C/50 \% relative humidity (RH); 35 ¬∞C/70 \% RH; and 42 ¬∞C/20 \% RH. Each session consisted of two 1-h treadmill walks at {\textasciitilde}350 W and {\textasciitilde}540 W intensity. T s and HF from six sites on the forehead, sternum, pectoralis, left rib cage, left scapula, and left thigh, and T c (i.e., core temperature pill used as a suppository) were measured. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to derive algorithms that estimate T c from T s and HF at each site. A simple model was developed to simulate influences of thermal conductivity and thickness of the local body tissues on the relationship between T c, T s, and HF.
RESULTS: Coefficient of determination (R (2)) ranged from 0.30 to 0.88, varying with locations and conditions. Good sites for T c measurement at surface were the sternum, and a combination of the sternum, scapula, and rib sites. The combination of T s and HF measured at the sternum explained {\textasciitilde}75 \% or more of variance in observed T c in hot environments. The forehead was found unsuitable for exercise in heat due to sweating and evaporative heat loss. The derived algorithms are likely applicable only for the same ensemble or ensembles with similar thermal and vapor resistances.
CONCLUSION: Algorithms for T c measurement are location-specific and their accuracy is dependent, to a large degree, on sensor placement.},

However, the typical circadian markers, changes in melatonin (MLT), and core body temperature (CBT) are difficult to measure 24-hour cycle of daily life. In this study, to propose relatively easy-to-monitor cardiac rhythmicity-related indicators as circadian markers, the biomarkers, including MLT, CBT, heart rate (HR), and heart rate variability (HRV), were collected from 22 Korean men. The MLT and CBT showed the largest positive correlation with R wave-to-R wave (RR) interval (Pearson‚Äôs r =¬†.620, p {\textless}¬†.001) and HR (Pearson‚Äôs r =¬†.476, p {\textless}¬†.001), respectively.

An immediate goal of biomarkers is to help us answer the following three fundamental questions in aging research: How old are we? Why do we get old? And how can we age slower? This review aims to address this need. Here, we summarize our current knowledge of biomarkers developed for cellular, organ, and organismal levels of aging, comprising six pillars: physiological characteristics, medical imaging, histological features, cellular alterations, molecular changes, and secretory factors. To fulfill all these requisites, we propose that aging biomarkers should qualify for being specific, systemic, and clinically relevant.},

	abstract = {Organisms experience dramatic fluctuations in demands/stresses over the course of the day. In order to maintain biological processes within physiologic boundaries, it is imperative that mechanisms have evolved for anticipation of, and adaptation to, these daily fluctuations. Endocrine factors undoubtedly play an integral role in homeostasis. Not only do circulating levels of various endocrine factors oscillate over the 24 period, but so too does responsiveness of target tissues to these signals/stimuli. Emerging evidence suggests that these daily oscillations do not occur solely in response to behavioral fluctuations associated with sleep/wake and feeding/fasting cycles, but are orchestrated in part by an intrinsic timekeeping mechanism known as the circadian clock. Disruption of circadian clocks, through genetic and/or environmental means, appears to precipitate numerous common disorders, including cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. Collectively, these observations, which are reviewed within the current article, have led to suggestion that strategies designed to realign normal circadian rhythmicities hold a therapeutic potential for the treatment of various endocrine-related disorders.},

	abstract = {The challenging problems presented by noisy biological oscillators have led to the development of a great variety of methods for accurately estimating rhythmic parameters such as period and amplitude. This chapter focuses on wavelet-based methods, which can be quite effective for assessing how rhythms change over time, particularly if time series are at least a week in length. These methods can offer alternative views to complement more traditional methods of evaluating behavioral records. The analytic wavelet transform can estimate the instantaneous period and amplitude, as well as the phase of the rhythm at each time point, while the discrete wavelet transform can extract the circadian component of activity and measure the relative strength of that circadian component compared to those in other frequency bands. Wavelet transforms do not require the removal of noise or trend, and can, in fact, be effective at removing noise and trend from oscillatory time series. The Fourier periodogram and spectrogram are reviewed, followed by descriptions of the analytic and discrete wavelet transforms. Examples illustrate application of each method and their prior use in chronobiology is surveyed. Issues such as edge effects, frequency leakage, and implications of the uncertainty principle are also addressed.},

	abstract = {Aging is believed to occur across multiple domains, one of which is body composition; however, attempts to integrate it into biological age (BA) have been limited. Here, we consider the sex-dependent role of anthropometry for the prediction of 10-year all-cause mortality using data from 18,794 NHANES participants to generate and validate a new BA metric. Our data-driven approach pointed to sex-specific contributors for BA estimation: WHtR, arm and thigh circumferences for men; weight, WHtR, thigh circumference, subscapular and triceps skinfolds for women. We used these measurements to generate AnthropoAge, which predicted all-cause mortality (AUROC 0.876, 95\%CI 0.864‚Äì0.887) and cause-specific mortality independently of ethnicity, sex, and comorbidities; AnthropoAge was a better predictor than PhenoAge for cerebrovascular, Alzheimer, and COPD mortality. A metric of age acceleration was also derived and used to assess sexual dimorphisms linked to accelerated aging, where women had an increase in overall body mass plus an important subcutaneous to visceral fat redistribution, and men displayed a marked decrease in fat and muscle mass. Finally, we showed that consideration of multiple BA metrics may identify unique aging trajectories with increased mortality (HR for multidomain acceleration 2.43, 95\%CI 2.25‚Äì2.62) and comorbidity profiles. A simplified version of AnthropoAge (S-AnthropoAge) was generated using only BMI and WHtR, all results were preserved using this metric. In conclusion, AnthropoAge is a useful proxy of BA that captures cause-specific mortality and sex dimorphisms in body composition, and it could be used for future multidomain assessments of aging to better characterize the heterogeneity of this phenomenon.},

Although the circadian timing system is known to regulate a wide range of physiological functions, its implication in pain regulation is largely unknown.Using highly controlled laboratory constant-routine conditions, we show that pain sensitivity is rhythmic over the 24‚ÄÖh and strongly controlled by the endogenous circadian timing system. We found that the circadian component of pain sensitivity can be modelled with a sinusoidal function, with a maximum in the middle of the night and a minimum in the afternoon. We also found a weak homeostatic control of pain sensitivity, with a linear increase over the 34‚ÄÖh of prolonged wakefulness, which slowly builds up with sleep pressure. Using mathematical modelling, we describe that the circadian system accounts for ‚àº80\% of the full magnitude of pain sensitivity over the 24‚ÄÖh, and that sleep-related processes account for only ‚àº20\%.Overall, our data reveal the neurobiological mechanisms involved in driving the rhythmicity of pain perception in humans. We show that pain sensitivity is controlled by two superimposed processes: a strong circadian component and a modest homeostatic sleep-related component. Our findings highlight the need to consider time of day in pain assessment, and indicate that personalized circadian medicine may be a promising approach to pain management.},

It is well known that some clinical signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) vary within a day and between days, and the morning stiffness seen in patients with RA has become one of the diagnostic criteria of the disease (fig 1).1



 Figure 1  
Clinical signs and symptoms of articular inflammation in patients with RA change consistently as a function of the hours of the day: pain and joint stiffness are greater after waking up in the morning than in the afternoon or evening.



Among the clinical signs of joint inflammation in patients with RA, the intensity of pain changes consistently as a function of the hours of the day: pain is greater after waking up in the morning than in the afternoon or evening.2 In patients with RA circadian variations are also found in joint swelling and finger size and these symptoms are in phase with the circadian rhythm of pain. The RA rhythms differ in phase by about 12 hours from the circadian changes of left and right hand grip strength: a greater grip strength is seen when joint circumferences and the subjective ratings of stiffness and pain are least and vice versa.3

‚ÄúClinical signs and symptoms in RA depend on the time of day‚Äù 

Therefore, clinical signs and symptoms in RA show a rhythm that seems driven by a biological clock.

Biological rhythms have been seen in different models of inflammation, and maximal inflammation occurred during the activity period of the animals‚Äîthat is, between midnight and 8 00 am.4

Biological rhythms with a periodicity longer than 24 hours have also been detected, and a circaseptan rhythm (almost seven days) of paw oedema, over a period of 30 days, was observed, with peak of inflammation every 6‚Äì7 days.5 Furthermore, ‚Ä¶},

Recently, our understanding of circadian rhythms and their regulation at genomic and physiologic scales has grown significantly. Knowledge of the circadian influence on biological processes has provided new possibilities for novel pharmacological strategies. Directly targeting the biological clock or its downstream targets, and/or using timing as a variable in drug therapy are now important pharmacological considerations. The circadian machinery mediates many aspects of the inflammatory response and, reciprocally, an inflammatory environment can disrupt circadian rhythms. Therefore, intense interest exists in leveraging circadian biology as a means to treat chronic inflammatory diseases such as sepsis, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and cardiovascular disease, which all display some type of circadian signature. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the crosstalk between circadian rhythms, inflammatory diseases, and their pharmacological treatment. Evidence suggests that carefully rationalized application of chronotherapy strategies ‚Äì alone or in combination with small molecule modulators of circadian clock components ‚Äì can improve efficacy and reduce toxicity, thus warranting further investigation and use.},

Inflammatory and metabolic processes vary through circadian time, suggesting an important temporal crosstalk between these systems. Using an established mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, we show that chronic inflammatory arthritis results in rhythmic joint inflammation and drives major changes in muscle and liver energy metabolism and rhythmic gene expression. Transcriptional and phosphoproteomic analyses revealed alterations in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function associated with increased EGFR-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Metabolomic analyses confirmed rhythmic metabolic rewiring with impaired Œ≤-oxidation and lipid handling and revealed a pronounced shunt toward sphingolipid and ceramide accumulation. The arthritis-related production of ceramides was most pronounced during the day, which is the time of peak inflammation and increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation. Thus, our data demonstrate that localized joint inflammation drives a time-of-day‚Äìdependent build-up of bioactive lipid species driven by rhythmic inflammation and altered EGFR-STAT signaling.},

	abstract = {There is strong diurnal variation in the symptoms and severity of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, disruption of the circadian clock is an aggravating factor associated with a range of human inflammatory diseases. To investigate mechanistic links between the biological clock and pathways underlying inflammatory arthritis, mice were administered collagen (or saline as a control) to induce arthritis. The treatment provoked an inflammatory response within the limbs, which showed robust daily variation in paw swelling and inflammatory cytokine expression. Inflammatory markers were significantly repressed during the dark phase. Further work demonstrated an active molecular clock within the inflamed limbs and highlighted the resident inflammatory cells, fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), as a potential source of the rhythmic inflammatory signal. Exposure of mice to constant light disrupted the clock in peripheral tissues, causing loss of the nighttime repression of local inflammation. Finally, the results show that the core clock proteins cryptochrome (CRY) 1 and 2 repressed inflammation within the FLSs, and provide novel evidence that a CRY activator has anti-inflammatory properties in human cells. We conclude that under chronic inflammatory conditions, the clock actively represses inflammatory pathways during the dark phase. This interaction has exciting potential as a therapeutic avenue for treatment of inflammatory disease.-Hand, L. E., Hopwood, T. W., Dickson, S. H., Walker, A. L., Loudon, A. S. I., Ray, D.

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate overnight variations in absolute values and patterns of cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumour necrosis factor Œ± (TNFŒ±) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to relate any changes to those occurring in blood cortisol.
Methods: A total of 16 people (8 female) with active RA and who had received no recent glucocorticoids were admitted overnight. Blood samples were obtained at 13 time points between 21.00 and 10.00.
Results: The geometric mean IL6 concentration rose significantly from 35 pg/ml at 22:00 to 64 pg/ml at 07:15 (repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), p{\textless}0.001). The geometric mean cortisol concentration rose significantly overnight from 57 ng/ml at 01:00 to 229 ng/ml at 07:15 (repeated measures ANOVA, p{\textless}0.001). Neither TNFŒ± nor the other cytokines measured changed significantly. Using cubic regression modelling IL6 began to rise before cortisol (range 0.01 to 4.83 h) in eight participants and after cortisol (range 1.11 to 5.14 h) in three participants. In a random coefficient model including data from all participants, the estimated mean IL6 value began to rise 3.05 h before the estimated mean cortisol value, with the IL6 peak occurring 0.70 h before the cortisol peak.
Conclusion: The mean IL6 and cortisol concentrations showed a significant overnight variation. Neither TNFŒ± nor the other cytokines measured changed significantly. In a random coefficient model IL6 began to rise approximately 3 h, and reached a peak about 40 min, before cortisol. These studies confirm that there are abnormalities in plasma cortisol and IL6 concentrations and dynamics. The data also link the overnight rise in IL6 to the circadian variation in symptoms.},

Here, we report a patient who complained of abdominal distention and constipation after chemotherapy for hematological malignancies, and was diagnosed with secondary PCI via computed tomography (CT) and exploratory laparotomy. Pneumoperitoneum was no longer observed after two weeks of conservative treatments. Notably, the possibility of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) as a predictor for surgical intervention was proposed. Furthermore, we conducted a literature review on PCI after chemotherapy in hematological malignancies to raise awareness of etoposide-related PCI, while whether PCI could be identified as an adverse event of etoposide requires more evidence.},

The metabolic syndrome has direct effects on health and increases the risk of developing cancer. Lifestyle factors that are known to promote the metabolic syndrome generally cause pro-inflammatory alterations in microbiota communities in the intestine. Indeed, alterations to the structure and function of intestinal microbiota are sufficient to promote the metabolic syndrome, inflammation and cancer. Among the lifestyle factors that are associated with the metabolic syndrome, disruption of the circadian system, known as circadian dysrhythmia, is increasingly common. Disruption of the circadian system can alter microbiome communities and can perturb host metabolism, energy homeostasis and inflammatory pathways, which leads to the metabolic syndrome.

Here we use a genome-wide approach to investigate circadian gene and metabolite expression in the lungs of endotoxemic mice and find that novel cellular and molecular circadian rhythms are elicited in this setting. The endotoxin-specific circadian programme exhibits unique features, including a divergent group of rhythmic genes and metabolites compared with the basal state and a distinct periodicity and phase distribution. At the cellular level, endotoxin treatment also alters circadian rhythms of leukocyte counts within the lung in a bmal1-dependent manner, such that granulocytes rather than lymphocytes become the dominant oscillating cell type. Our results show that inflammation produces a complex re-organization of cellular and molecular circadian rhythms that are relevant to early events in lung injury.},

Many physiological variables related to survival during critical illness have a circadian rhythm, including the sleep/wake cycle, haemodynamic and respiratory indices, immunity and coagulation, but their clinical significance remains underappreciated. Critically ill patients suffer from circadian dysrhythmia, manifesting overtly as sleep disturbance and delirium, but with widespread covert effects on cellular and organ function. Environmental and pharmacological strategies that ameliorate or prevent circadian dysrhythmia have demonstrated clinical benefit. Harnessing these important biological phenomena to match metabolic supply to demand and bolster cell defenses at the apposite time may be a future therapeutic strategy in the intensive care unit.},

Methotrexate was administered at two different dosing times based on these findings to estimate arthritis.The arthritis score was significantly lower in the 22 HALO-treated group than in the control and 10 HALO-treated groups in collagen-induced arthritic rats and mice. Plasma TNF-Œ± concentrations showed obvious 24-h rhythms, with higher levels at light phase and lower levels at dark phase after rheumatoid arthritis crisis. Arthritis was relieved after administration of methotrexate during the dark phase in synchronization with the 24-h rhythm.Our findings suggest that choosing an optimal dosing time associated with the 24-h cycling of TNF-Œ± could lead to effective treatment of rheumatoid arthritis by methotrexate.},

Anti-inflammatory regulatory T (Treg) cells within the joints show diurnal variation, with numbers peaking during the nadir of inflammation. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory action of Treg cells on innate immune cells contributes to the night-time repression of inflammation. Treg cells do not seem to have intrinsic circadian oscillators, suggesting that rhythmic function might be a consequence of external signals. These data support a model in which non-rhythmic Treg cells are driven to rhythmic activity by systemic signals to confer a circadian signature to chronic arthritis.},

Nutrition habits can influence the risk for MS, and dietary interventions may be effective in modulating MS disease course. Chronotherapeutic approaches such as time-restricted eating (TRE) may benefit people with MS by stabilizing the circadian clock and restoring immunological and metabolic rhythms, thus potentially counteracting disease progression. This review provides a summary of selected studies on dietary intervention in MS, circadian rhythms, and their disruption in MS, including clock gene variations, circadian hormones, and retino-hypothalamic tract changes. Furthermore, we present studies that reported diurnal variations in MS, which might result from circadian disruption.

Here, we continuously monitored week-long glucose levels in an 800-person cohort, measured responses to 46,898 meals, and found high variability in the response to identical meals, suggesting that universal dietary recommendations may have limited utility.¬†We devised a machine-learning algorithm that integrates blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota measured in this cohort and showed that it accurately predicts personalized postprandial glycemic response to real-life meals. We validated these predictions in an independent 100-person cohort. Finally, a blinded randomized controlled dietary intervention based on this algorithm resulted in significantly lower postprandial responses and consistent alterations to gut microbiota configuration. Together, our results suggest that personalized diets may successfully modify elevated postprandial blood glucose and its metabolic consequences.

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are endogenous 24-hr oscillations usually entrained to daily environmental cycles of light/dark. Many biological processes and physiological functions including mammalian body temperature, the cell cycle, sleep/wake cycles, neurobehavioral performance, and a wide range of diseases including metabolic, cardiovascular, and psychiatric disorders are impacted by these rhythms. Circadian clocks are present within individual cells and at tissue and organismal levels as emergent properties from the interaction of cellular oscillators. Mathematical models of circadian rhythms have been proposed to provide a better understanding of and to predict aspects of this complex physiological system. These models can be used to: (a) manipulate the system in silico with specificity that cannot be easily achieved using in vivo and in vitro experimental methods and at lower cost, (b) resolve apparently contradictory empirical results, (c) generate hypotheses, (d) design new experiments, and (e) to design interventions for altering circadian rhythms. Mathematical models differ in structure, the underlying assumptions, the number of parameters and variables, and constraints on variables. Models representing circadian rhythms at different physiologic scales and in different species are reviewed to promote understanding of these models and facilitate their use.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence on the comparative performance of purified protein derivative tuberculin skin tests (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) for predicting incident active tuberculosis (TB) remains conflicting. We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis to directly compare the predictive performance for incident TB disease between TST and IGRA to inform policy.
METHODS: We searched Medline and Embase from 1 January 2002 to 4 September 2020, and studies that were included in previous systematic reviews. We included prospective longitudinal studies in which participants received both TST and IGRA and estimated performance as hazard ratios (HR) for the development of all diagnoses of TB in participants with dichotomised positive test results compared to negative results, using different thresholds of positivity for TST. Secondary analyses included an evaluation of the impact of background TB incidence. We also estimated the sensitivity and specificity for predicting TB. We explored heterogeneity through pre-defined sub-group analyses (e.g. country-level TB incidence). Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. This review is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020205667.
FINDINGS: We obtained data from 13 studies out of 40 that were considered eligible (N¬†=¬†32,034 participants: 36\% from countries with TB incidence rate ‚â•100 per 100,000 population). All reported data on TST and QuantiFERON Gold in-Tube (QFT-GIT). The point estimate for the TST was highest with higher cut-offs for positivity and particularly when stratified by bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin vaccine (BCG) status (15¬†mm if BCG vaccinated and 5¬†mm if not [TST5/15 mm]) at 2.88 (95\% CI 1.69-4.90). The pooled HR for QFT-GIT was higher than for TST at 4.15 (95\% CI 1.97-8.75). The difference was large in countries with TB incidence rate {\textless}100 per 100,000 population (HR 10.38, 95\% CI 4.17-25.87 for QFT-GIT VS. HR 5.36, 95\% CI 3.82-7.51 for TST5/15 mm) but much of this difference was driven by a single study (HR 5.13, 95\% CI 3.58-7.35 for TST5/15 mm VS. 7.18, 95\% CI 4.48-11.51 for QFT-GIT, when excluding the study, in which all 19¬†TB cases had positive QFT-GIT results). The comparative performance was similar in the higher burden countries (HR 1.61, 95\% CI 1.23-2.10 for QFT-GIT VS. HR 1.72, 95\% CI 0.98-3.01 for TST5/15 mm). The predictive performance of both tests was higher in countries with TB incidence rate {\textless}100 per 100,000 population. In the lower TB incidence countries, the specificity of TST (76\% for TST5/15 mm) and QFT-GIT (74\%) for predicting active TB approached the minimum World Health Organization target (‚â•75\%), but the sensitivity was below the target of ‚â•75\% (63\% for TST5/15 mm and 65\% for QFT-GIT). The absolute differences in positive and negative predictive values between TST15 mm and QFT-GIT were small (positive predictive values 2.74\% VS. 2.46\%; negative predictive values 99.42\% VS. 99.52\% in low-incidence countries). Egger's test did not show evidence of publication bias (0.74 for TST15 mm and p¬†=¬†0.68 for QFT-GIT).
INTERPRETATION: IGRA appears to have higher predictive performance than the TST in low TB incidence countries, but the difference was driven by a single study. Any advantage in clinical performance may be small, given the numerically similar positive and negative predictive values. Both IGRA and TST had lower performance in countries with high TB incidence. Test choice should be contextual and made considering operational and likely clinical impact of test results.

	abstract = {Age is a dominant risk factor for some of the most common neurological diseases. Biological ageing encompasses interindividual variation in the rate of ageing and can be calculated from clinical biomarkers or DNA methylation data amongst other approaches. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a biological age greater than one's chronological age affects the risk of future neurological diagnosis and the development of abnormal signs on clinical examination.We analysed data from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA): a cohort with 3175 assessments of 802 individuals followed-up over several decades. Six measures of biological ageing were generated: two physiological ages (created from bedside clinical measurements and standard blood tests) and four blood methylation age measures. Their effects on future stroke, dementia or Parkinson's disease diagnosis, or development of abnormal clinical signs, were determined using survival analysis, with and without stratification by twin pairs.Older physiological ages were associated with ischaemic stroke risk; for example one standard deviation advancement in baseline PhenoAgePhys or KDMAgePhys residual increased future ischaemic stroke risk by 29.2\% [hazard ratio (HR): 1.29, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.06‚Äì1.58, P = 0.012] and 42.9\% (HR 1.43, CI 1.18‚Äì1.73, P = 3.1 √ó 10‚àí4), respectively. In contrast, older methylation ages were more predictive of future dementia risk, which was increased by 29.7\% (HR 1.30, CI 1.07‚Äì1.57, P = 0.007) per standard deviation advancement in HorvathAgeMeth. Older physiological ages were also positively associated with future development of abnormal patellar or pupillary reflexes, and the loss of normal gait.Measures of biological ageing can predict clinically relevant pathology of the nervous system independent of chronological age. This may help to explain variability in disease risk between individuals of the same age and strengthens the case for trials of geroprotective interventions for people with neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {Females live longer than males, and there are sex disparities in physical health and disease incidence. However, sex differences in biological aging have not been consistently reported and may differ depending on the measure used. This study aimed to determine the correlations between epigenetic age acceleration (AA), and other markers of biological aging, separately in males and females. We additionally explored the extent to which these AA measures differed according to socioeconomic characteristics, clinical markers, and diseases. Epigenetic clocks (HorvathAge, HannumAge, PhenoAge, GrimAge, GrimAge2, and DunedinPACE) were estimated in blood from 560 relatively healthy Australians aged‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ70¬†years (females, 50.7\%) enrolled in the ASPREE study. A system-wide deficit accumulation frailty index (FI) composed of 67 health-related measures was generated. Brain age and subsequently brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) were estimated from neuroimaging. Females had significantly reduced AA than males, but higher FI, and there was no difference in brain-PAD. FI had the strongest correlation with DunedinPACE (range r: 0.21 to 0.24 in both sexes). Brain-PAD was not correlated with any biological aging measures. Significant correlations between AA and sociodemographic characteristics and health markers were more commonly found in females (e.g., for DunedinPACE and systolic blood pressure r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.2, p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001) than in males. GrimAA and Grim2AA were significantly associated with obesity and depression in females, while in males, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease were associated with these clocks, as well as DunedinPACE. Our findings highlight the importance of considering sex differences when investigating the link between biological age and clinical measures.},

Blood-based biomarkers have been identified as suitable candidates for biological age estimation. This study aims to improve biological age estimation using machine learning models and a feature-set of 60 circulating biomarkers available from the UK Biobank (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ306,116). We implement an Elastic-Net derived Cox model with 25 selected biomarkers to predict mortality risk (C-Index = 0.778; 95\% CI [0.767‚Äì0.788]), which outperforms the well-known blood-biomarker based PhenoAge model (C-Index = 0.750; 95\% CI [0.739‚Äì0.761]), providing a C-Index lift of 0.028 representing an 11\% relative increase in predictive value. Importantly, we then show that using common clinical assay panels, with few biomarkers, alongside imputation and the model derived on the full set of biomarkers, does not substantially degrade predictive accuracy from the theoretical maximum achievable for the available biomarkers. Biological age is estimated as the equivalent age within the same-sex population which corresponds to an individual‚Äôs mortality risk. Values ranged between 20-years younger and 20-years older than individuals‚Äô chronological age, exposing the magnitude of ageing signals contained in blood markers. Thus, we demonstrate a practical and cost-efficient method of estimating an improved measure of Biological Age, available to the general population.},

Circadian rhythms are controlled by internal molecular feedback loops that synchronize the organism with the external environment. These loops are affected by genetic and epigenetic factors. Genetic factors include polymorphisms and mutations of circadian genes. The expression of circadian genes is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms that change from prenatal development to old age. Epigenetic modifications are influenced by the external environment. Most of these modifications are affected by our own life style. Irregular circadian rhythm and low quality of sleep have been shown to increase the risk of developing T2DM and other metabolic disorders. Here, we attempt to provide a wide description of mutual relationships between epigenetic regulation, circadian rhythm, aging process and highlight new evidences that show possible therapeutic advance in the field of chrono-medicine which will be more important in the upcoming years.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: Consumer-based physical activity (PA) monitors have become popular tools to track PA behaviours. Currently, little is known about the validity of the measurements provided by consumer monitors. We aimed to compare measures of steps, energy expenditure (EE) and active minutes of four consumer monitors with one research-grade accelerometer within a semistructured protocol.
METHODS: Thirty men and women (18-80 years old) wore Fitbit One (worn at the waist), Fitbit Zip (waist), Fitbit Flex (wrist), Jawbone UP24 (wrist) and one waist-worn research-grade accelerometer (ActiGraph) while participating in an 80‚Äâmin protocol. A validated EE prediction equation and active minute cut-points were applied to ActiGraph data. Criterion measures were assessed using direct observation (step count) and portable metabolic analyser (EE, active minutes). A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare differences between consumer monitors, ActiGraph, and criterion measures. Similarly, a repeated measures ANOVA was applied to a subgroup of subjects who didn't cycle.
RESULTS: Participants took 3321¬±571 steps, had 28¬±6‚Äâactive min and expended 294¬±56 kcal based on criterion measures. Comparatively, all monitors underestimated steps and EE by 13\%-32\% (p{\textless}0.01); additionally the Fitbit Flex, UP24, and ActiGraph underestimated active minutes by 35\%-65\% (p{\textless}0.05). Underestimations of PA and EE variables were found to be similar in the subgroup analysis.
CONCLUSION: Consumer monitors had similar accuracy for PA assessment as the ActiGraph, which suggests that consumer monitors may serve to track personal PA behaviours and EE. However, due to discrepancies among monitors, individuals should be cautious when comparing relative and absolute differences in PA values obtained using different monitors.},

OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to examine the use of wearable health care devices and the key predictors of wearable use by US adults.
METHODS: Using a national survey of 4551 respondents, we examined the usage patterns of wearable health care devices (use of wearables, frequency of their use, and willingness to share health data from a wearable with a provider) and a set of predictors that pertain to personal demographics (age, gender, race, education, marital status, and household income), individual health (general health, presence of chronic conditions, weight perceptions, frequency of provider visits, and attitude towards exercise), and technology self-efficacy using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: About 30\% (1266/4551) of US adults use wearable health care devices. Among the users, nearly half (47.33\%) use the devices every day, with a majority (82.38\% weighted) willing to share the health data from wearables with their care providers. Women (16.25\%), White individuals (19.74\%), adults aged 18-50 years (19.52\%), those with some level of college education or college graduates (25.60\%), and those with annual household incomes greater than US \$75,000 (17.66\%) were most likely to report using wearable health care devices. We found that the use of wearables declines with age: Adults aged {\textgreater}50 years were less likely to use wearables compared to those aged 18-34 years (odds ratios [OR] 0.46-0.57). Women (OR 1.26, 95\% CI 0.96-1.65), White individuals (OR 1.65, 95\% CI 0.97-2.79), college graduates (OR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.31-3.51), and those with annual household incomes greater than US \$75,000 (OR 2.6, 95\% CI 1.39-4.86) were more likely to use wearables. US adults who reported feeling healthier (OR 1.17, 95\% CI 0.98-1.39), were overweight (OR 1.16, 95\% CI 1.06-1.27), enjoyed exercise (OR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.06-1.43), and reported higher levels of technology self-efficacy (OR 1.33, 95\% CI 1.21-1.46) were more likely to adopt and use wearables for tracking or monitoring their health.
CONCLUSIONS: The potential of wearable health care devices is under-realized, with less than one-third of US adults actively using these devices. With only younger, healthier, wealthier, more educated, technoliterate adults using wearables, other groups have been left behind. More concentrated efforts by clinicians, device makers, and health care policy makers are needed to bridge this divide and improve the use of wearable devices among larger sections of American society.},

	abstract = {The circadian clock is a collection of endogenous oscillators with a periodicity of {\textasciitilde} 24 h. Recently, our understanding of circadian rhythms and their regulation at genomic and physiologic scales has grown significantly. Knowledge of the circadian influence on biological processes has provided new possibilities for novel pharmacological strategies. Directly targeting the biological clock or its downstream targets, and/or using timing as a variable in drug therapy are now important pharmacological considerations. The circadian machinery mediates many aspects of the inflammatory response and, reciprocally, an inflammatory environment can disrupt circadian rhythms. Therefore, intense interest exists in leveraging circadian biology as a means to treat chronic inflammatory diseases such as sepsis, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and cardiovascular disease, which all display some type of circadian signature. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the crosstalk between circadian rhythms, inflammatory diseases, and their pharmacological treatment. Evidence suggests that carefully rationalized application of chronotherapy strategies ‚Äì alone or in combination with small molecule modulators of circadian clock components ‚Äì can improve efficacy and reduce toxicity, thus warranting further investigation and use.},

	abstract = {It is evident that the morning symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are linked to the circadian abnormal increase in night inflammation, favoured by inadequate cortisol secretion under conditions of active disease. Therefore, exogenous glucocorticoid treatment is recommended in RA at low doses since it may partially act like a ‚Äòreplacement therapy‚Äô. The prevention/treatment of the night upregulation of the immune/inflammatory reaction (and related flare of cytokine synthesis) has been shown to be more effective when exogenous glucocorticoid administration is obtained with a night-time-release formulation. Large-scale trials documented that modified-release prednisone has greater efficacy then morning prednisone for long-term low-dose glucocorticoid treatment in patients with RA, showing at least a more significant reduction in morning joint stiffness. Interestingly, despite a considerably higher cost than conventional prednisone, chronotherapy with night-time-release prednisone was recognised as a cost-effective option for patients with RA not on glucocorticoids who are eligible for therapy with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Moreover, since different cell populations involved in the inflammatory process are particularly activated during the night, other therapeutical approaches used in RA, for example, conventional DMARDs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), should follow the same concepts of glucocorticoid chronotherapy. Indeed, bedtime methotrexate chronotherapy was found to improve RA symptoms compared to the current standard dosing methods, and several available NSAIDs (ie, indomethacin, aceclofenac, ketoprofen, flurbiporfen, lornoxicam) have been very recently modified in their formulation, in order to obtain chronotherapeutical effects in RA.},

Among 425 disease conditions (range n‚Äâ=‚Äâ200-6728) compared to controls (range n‚Äâ=‚Äâ62,107-91,134), a total of 73 (17\%) disease phenotypes were significantly associated with decreased amplitudes of wrist temperature (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR q‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.05) and 26 (6.1\%) PheCODEs passed a more stringent significance level (Bonferroni-correction Œ±‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.05).

	abstract = {To describe circadian blood pressure (BP) patterns and linear interdialytic changes, a model was developed to describe simultaneously both the straight line change and oscillatory variation in BP and heart rate over an interdialytic interval in hemodialysis patients. Using this trended cosinor model, we simultaneously compared the impact of mean level of BP, linear changes over the interdialytic interval, and oscillatory changes in BP and its relationship with antihypertensive drug use. Neither a straight-line change model nor the cosinor model adequately described the BP variability in 12 750 BP measurements from 136 chronic stable hemodialysis patients. A combination of the 2 models that allowed for the oscillatory rhythmic pattern in BP variation to have an upward trend in the interdialytic period most accurately described the data. Time elapsed since the end of dialysis demonstrated a better model fit compared with the less meaningful clock time. More antihypertensive medication use was associated with increasing mean systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure. Although the rate of change was blunted with increasing antihypertensive drug use, the impact on oscillatory change was U-shaped for systolic BP, direct for diastolic BP, and inverse for pulse pressure. A trended cosinor model better describes the change in BP in the interdialytic interval in hemodialysis patients, especially when time elapsed is measured from the end of dialysis. Antihypertensive drugs, though associated with higher average BP, are associated with blunted rate of change in BP over time.},

Several factors may contribute to this inconsistency, including limited sample sizes, confounding effects of antihyperlipidemic treatment, age, and body mass index, and the assumption that the association follows a simple linear function. Here, we aimed to address these factors by combining visualization and quantification a large-scale contemporary electronic health record database (the All of Us Research Program). We find clear visual and quantitative evidence that breast cancer is strongly, positively, and near-linearly associated with total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but not associated with triglycerides. The association of breast cancer with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was non-linear and age dependent. Standardized odds ratios were 2.12 (95\% confidence interval 1.9-2.48), P‚Äâ=‚Äâ5.6‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí31 for total cholesterol; 1.99 (1.75-2.26), P‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.6‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí26 for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; 1.69 (1.3-2.2), P‚Äâ=‚Äâ9.0‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí5 for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at age‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ56; and 0.65 (0.55-0.78), P‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.2‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí6 for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at age‚Äâ‚©æ‚Äâ56.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) are common complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that include myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and heart failure (HF). The objective of the current study was to predict MACE among T2DM patients.
METHODS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients above 18 years old were recruited for the study from the All of Us Research Program. Eligible participants were those who took sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. Different Machine learning algorithms: including RandomForest (RF), XGBoost, logistic regression (LR), and weighted ensemble model (WEM) were employed. Clinical attributes, electrolytes and biomarkers were explored in predicting MACE. The feature importance was determined using mean decrease accuracy.
RESULTS: Overall, 9, 059 subjects were included in the analyses, of which 5197 (57.4\%) were females. The XGBoost Model demonstrated a prediction accuracy of 0.80 [0.78-0.82], which is higher as compared to the RF 0.78[0.76-0.80], the LR model 0.65 [0.62-0.67], and the WEM 0.75 [0.73-0.76], respectively. The classification accuracy of the models for stroke was more than 95\%, which was higher than prediction accuracy for MI (‚àº85\%), and HF (‚àº80\%). Phosphate, blood urea nitrogen and troponin levels were the major predictors of MACE.
CONCLUSION: The ML models had shown acceptable performance in predicting MACE in T2DM patients, except the LR model. Phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, and other electrolytes were important predictors of MACE, which is consistent between the individual components of MACE, such as stroke, MI, and HF. These parameters can be calibrated as prognostic parameters of MACE events in T2DM patients.},

With the National Institute of Health All of Us (AoU) database, we employed machine learning (ML) to predict selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated bleeding.
METHODS: The AoU program, beginning in 05/2018, continues to recruit‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ18¬†years old individuals across the United States. Participants completed surveys and consented to contribute electronic health record (EHR) for research. Using the EHR, we determined participants who were exposed to SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, vortioxetine). Features (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ88) were selected with clinicians' input and comprised sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidities, and medication use information. We identified bleeding events with validated EHR algorithms and applied logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boost to predict bleeding during SSRI exposure. We assessed model performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic (AUC) and defined clinically significant features as resulting in‚Äâ{\textgreater}‚Äâ0.01 decline in AUC after removal from the model, in three of four ML models.
RESULTS: There were 10,362 participants exposed to SSRIs, with 9.6\% experiencing a bleeding event during SSRI exposure. For each SSRI, performance across all four ML models was relatively consistent. AUCs from the best models ranged 0.632-0.698. Clinically significant features included health literacy for escitalopram, and bleeding history and socioeconomic status for all SSRIs.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated feasibility of predicting ADEs using ML. Incorporating genomic features and drug interactions with deep learning models may improve ADE prediction.},

To characterize the advantages and drawbacks of different TRE attributes in facilitating cross-cohort analysis, we conduct a Genome-Wide Association Study of standard lipid measures using two approaches: meta-analysis and pooled analysis. Comparison of full summary data from both approaches with an external study shows strong correlation of known loci with lipid levels (R2‚Äâ{\textasciitilde}‚Äâ83-97\%). Importantly, 90 variants meet the significance threshold only in the meta-analysis and 64 variants are significant only in pooled analysis, with approximately 20\% of variants in each of those groups being most prevalent in non-European, non-Asian ancestry individuals. These findings have important implications, as technical and policy choices lead to cross-cohort analyses generating similar, but not identical results, particularly for non-European ancestral populations.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of artificial light exposure has enabled us to be active any time of the day or night, leading to the need for high alertness outside of traditional daytime hours. To address this need, we developed a personalized sleep intervention framework that analyzes real-world sleep-wake patterns obtained from wearable devices to maximize alertness during specific target periods. Our framework utilizes a mathematical model that tracks the dynamic sleep pressure and circadian rhythm based on the user's sleep history. In this way, the model accurately predicts real-time alertness, even for shift workers with complex sleep and work schedules (N‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ71, t‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ13{\textasciitilde}21 days). This allowed us to discover a new sleep-wake pattern called the adaptive circadian split sleep, which incorporates a main sleep period and a late nap to enable high alertness during both work and non-work periods of shift workers. We further developed a mobile application that integrates this framework to recommend practical, personalized sleep schedules for individual users to maximize their alertness during a targeted activity time based on their desired sleep onset and available sleep duration. This can reduce the risk of errors for those who require high alertness during nontraditional activity times and improve the health and quality of life for those leading shift work-like lifestyles.},

	abstract = {Background: Sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA), and insomnia are common and can have serious health consequences. However, accurately diagnosing these conditions can be challenging as a result of the underrecognition of these diseases, the time-intensive nature of sleep monitoring necessary for a proper diagnosis, and patients‚Äô hesitancy to undergo demanding and costly overnight polysomnography tests.
Objective: We aim to develop a machine learning algorithm that can accurately predict the risk of OSA, COMISA, and insomnia with a simple set of questions, without the need for a polysomnography test.
Methods: We applied extreme gradient boosting to the data from 2 medical centers (n=4257 from Samsung Medical Center and n=365 from Ewha Womans University Medical Center Seoul Hospital). Features were selected based on feature importance calculated by the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method. We applied extreme gradient boosting using selected features to develop a simple questionnaire predicting sleep disorders (SLEEPS). The accuracy of the algorithm was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve.
Results: In total, 9 features were selected to construct SLEEPS. SLEEPS showed high accuracy, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of greater than 0.897 for all 3 sleep disorders, and consistent performance across both sets of data. We found that the distinction between COMISA and OSA was critical for accurate prediction. A publicly accessible website was created based on the algorithm that provides predictions for the risk of the 3 sleep disorders and shows how the risk changes with changes in weight or age.
Conclusions: SLEEPS has the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders by providing more accessibility and convenience. The creation of a publicly accessible website based on the algorithm provides a user-friendly tool for assessing the risk of OSA, COMISA, and insomnia.},

Participants 156 848 women in the multivariable regression and one sample mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis in UK Biobank (7784 with a breast cancer diagnosis) and 122 977 breast cancer cases and 105 974 controls from BCAC in the two sample MR analysis.
Exposures Self reported chronotype (morning or evening preference), insomnia symptoms, and sleep duration in multivariable regression, and genetic variants robustly associated with these sleep traits.
Main outcome measure Breast cancer diagnosis.
Results In multivariable regression analysis using UK Biobank data on breast cancer incidence, morning preference was inversely associated with breast cancer (hazard ratio 0.95, 95\% confidence interval 0.93 to 0.98 per category increase), whereas there was little evidence for an association between sleep duration and insomnia symptoms. Using 341 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with chronotype, 91 SNPs associated with sleep duration, and 57 SNPs associated with insomnia symptoms, one sample MR analysis in UK Biobank provided some supportive evidence for a protective effect of morning preference on breast cancer risk (0.85, 0.70, 1.03 per category increase) but imprecise estimates for sleep duration and insomnia symptoms. Two sample MR using data from BCAC supported findings for a protective effect of morning preference (inverse variance weighted odds ratio 0.88, 95\% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.93 per category increase) and adverse effect of increased sleep duration (1.19, 1.02 to 1.39 per hour increase) on breast cancer risk (both oestrogen receptor positive and oestrogen receptor negative), whereas evidence for insomnia symptoms was inconsistent. Results were largely robust to sensitivity analyses accounting for horizontal pleiotropy.
Conclusions Findings showed consistent evidence for a protective effect of morning preference and suggestive evidence for an adverse effect of increased sleep duration on breast cancer risk.},

	abstract = {Late diurnal preference has been linked to poorer mental health outcomes, but the understanding of the causal role of diurnal preference on mental health and wellbeing is currently limited. Late diurnal preference is often associated with circadian misalignment (a mismatch between the timing of the endogenous circadian system and behavioural rhythms), so that evening people live more frequently against their internal clock. This study aims to quantify the causal contribution of diurnal preference on mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression and general wellbeing and test the hypothesis that more misaligned individuals have poorer mental health and wellbeing using an actigraphy-based measure of circadian misalignment. Multiple Mendelian Randomisation (MR) approaches were used to test causal pathways between diurnal preference and seven well-validated mental health and wellbeing outcomes in up to 451,025 individuals. In addition, observational analyses tested the association between a novel, objective measure of behavioural misalignment (Composite Phase Deviation, CPD) and seven mental health and wellbeing outcomes. Using genetic instruments identified in the largest GWAS for diurnal preference, we provide robust evidence that early diurnal preference is protective for depression and improves wellbeing. For example, using one-sample MR, a twofold higher genetic liability of morningness was associated with lower odds of depressive symptoms (OR: 0.92, 95\% CI: 0.88, 0.97). It is possible that behavioural factors including circadian misalignment may contribute in the chronotype depression relationship, but further work is needed to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {Background
Circadian rhythms are fundamental to health and are particularly important for mental wellbeing. Disrupted rhythms of rest and activity are recognised as risk factors for major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.

Methods
We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of low relative amplitude (RA), an objective measure of rest-activity cycles derived from the accelerometer data of 71,500 UK Biobank participants. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for low RA were used to investigate potential associations with psychiatric phenotypes.

Outcomes
Two independent genetic loci were associated with low RA, within genomic regions for Neurofascin (NFASC) and Solute Carrier Family 25 Member 17 (SLC25A17). A secondary GWAS of RA as a continuous measure identified a locus within Meis Homeobox 1 (MEIS1). There were no significant genetic correlations between low RA and any of the psychiatric phenotypes assessed. However, PRS for low RA was significantly associated with mood instability across multiple PRS thresholds (at PRS threshold 0¬∑05: OR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1¬∑02, 95\% CI‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1¬∑01‚Äì1¬∑02, p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ9¬∑6‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚àí5), and with major depressive disorder (at PRS threshold 0¬∑1: OR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1¬∑03, 95\% CI‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1¬∑01‚Äì1¬∑05, p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0¬∑025) and neuroticism (at PRS threshold 0¬∑5: Beta‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0¬∑02, 95\% CI‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0¬∑007‚Äì0¬∑04, p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0¬∑021).

Interpretation
Overall, our findings contribute new knowledge on the complex genetic architecture of circadian rhythmicity and suggest a putative biological link between disrupted circadian function and mood disorder phenotypes, particularly mood instability, but also major depressive disorder and neuroticism.

This strain is predominantly caused by external (societal) demands including shift work, early school start times and fast travels across time zones. Sleeping at the 'wrong' internal time can jeopardise health and safety, and we therefore need a good quantification of this phenomenon. Here, we propose a novel method to quantify the mistiming of sleep-wake rhythms and demonstrate its versatility in day workers and shift workers. Based on a single time series, our Composite Phase Deviation method unveils distinct, subject- and schedule-specific geometries ('islands and pancakes') that illustrate how modern work times interfere with sleep. With increasing levels of circadian strain, the resulting shapes change systematically from small, connected forms to large and fragmented patterns. Our method shows good congruence with published measures of circadian misalignment (i.e., Inter-daily Stability and 'Behavioural Entrainment'), but offers added value as to its requirements, e.g., being computable for sleep logs and questionnaires. Composite Phase Deviations will help to understand the mechanisms that link 'living against the clock' with health and disease on an individual basis.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The objective of the study was to describe working and sleep conditions¬†and to assess how sleep opportunities are associated with obtained sleep and alertness, in a sample of long-haul bus drivers working with a two-up operations system.
Methods
Measures of subjective sleep and sleepiness, actigraphy, circadian temperature rhythm, and psychomotor vigilance tasks were obtained from a sample of 122 drivers from Argentina. Variables were compared between high and low fatigue risk groups, which were formed using a median split of a fatigue risk score. The score was calculated based on drivers' total working hours, maximum shift duration, minimum short break duration, maximum night work per seven days, and long break frequencies.
Results
Considering a standardized one-day period, sleep in the bus accounted for 1.9¬±0.1 h of total sleep (57¬±1\% efficiency), sleep at destination for 1.6¬±0.2 h of total sleep (90¬±1\% efficiency), and sleep at home for 3.8¬±0.2 h of total sleep (89¬±1\% nap efficiency and 90¬±1\% anchor sleep efficiency). In drivers exposed to high-risk working schedules, the circadian temperature rhythm was weaker (lower \% of variance explained by the model) (22.0¬±1.7\% vs. 27.6¬±2.0\%, p {\textless}0.05) and without a significant acrophase.
Conclusions
Drivers obtained a total amount of weekly sleep similar to the recommended levels for adults, but distributed at different locations and at different times during the day. High-risk working schedules were associated with disruption of circadian temperature rhythms. These results point out to the need of the implementation of shift-work scheduling strategies to minimize sleep misalignment and circadian desynchronization in long-haul bus drivers.},

	abstract = {We recently developed the Composite Phase Deviation (CPD), a metric that quantifies mistiming of sleep along two dimensions: (i) relative to an individual‚Äôs habitual sleep timing, and (ii) relative to their sleep timing on the previous day. Given recent findings that sleep regularity can be predictive of mood, we examined whether CPD is also associated with mood in college students.Daily mood and actigraphy data were collected for {\textasciitilde}30 days from 223 college students between 2013 and 2016. Participants rated their mood daily upon awakening on five visual scales (later scored 0‚Äì100): sleepy-alert, sad-happy, sluggish-energetic, sick-healthy, stressed-calm. Four different sleep parameters were computed after combining actigraphy and sleep-diaries: sleep duration, midsleep time, chronotype, and CPD. Chronotype was calculated as average midsleep time on weekends, corrected for sleep loss on weekdays. CPD quantifies the difference in midsleep timing between consecutive days and relative to chronotype, with higher values representing greater timing differences. Linear mixed models with random intercept for each participant were computed to predict daily mood as well as average mood over {\textasciitilde}30 days.A later daily midsleep time was associated with feeling more alert (unstandardized regression coefficient b=0.36), happier (b=0.31), and calmer (b=0.71) upon awakening, while a later chronotype was associated with feeling less alert (b=-2.31) and less energetic (b=-1.96) (all p\&lt;0.05). Sleep duration was the strongest predictor for daily mood upon awakening (longer sleep, better mood), but sleep duration was not associated with how students felt on average across the month of study. In contrast, CPD did not predict daily changes in mood but was the strongest predictor for average mood: students with higher CPD rated their mood as generally lower.Different dimensions of sleep were associated with differential effects on mood. While sleep duration was predictive of daily mood fluctuations, CPD was associated with an individual‚Äôs average mood level. CPD may be more predictive of daily mood in a work context that imposes highly irregular sleep patterns, such as shift work.R00HL119618, K24HL105664, R01HL114088, R01GM105018, R01HL128538, P01AG009975.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Theoretical accounts and psychological interventions for bipolar disorder indicate that disruption of circadian rhythms is important, both in affective episodes and as a vulnerability factor in subsyndromal periods. This study aims at assessing both circadian activity and sleep patterns using actigraphy within a bipolar sample experiencing low levels of subsyndromal symptoms. It is hypothesized that such participants will display circadian activity disruption in spite of low levels of symptoms. Methods: This study employed a mixed design with cross-sectional assessment of mood and week-long (7-day) recording of actigraphy data. All clinical participants were psychiatric outpatients within a UK NHS Hospital. Nineteen bipolar patients and 19 age- and gender-matched controls wore an actigraph for 7 days to obtain sleep and circadian activity data. SCID was used to confirm DSM-IV diagnostic status. Self-report measures of mood were obtained from both groups. Results: Bipolar patients were found to have less stable and more variable circadian activity patterns than controls. Regression analysis indicated that variability alone was a significant independent predictor of diagnostic group. There was evidence from raw activity data that bipolar patients were also less active than controls. These differences were not associated with levels of subsyndromal symptoms. Bipolar patients did not differ from controls on any of the sleep indices used. Conclusions: Circadian activity disruption is apparent in bipolar patients even when not acutely ill. This finding is not associated with the presence of sleep disturbance. Should such patterns be replicated interventions to address both circadian instability and individual attributions for the effects of such instability are likely to be relevant to successful psychological interventions.},

	abstract = {Background
Accelerometers are included in a wide range of devices that monitor and track physical activity for health-related applications. However, the clinical utility of the information embedded in their rich time-series data has been greatly understudied and has yet to be fully realized. Here, we examine the potential for fractal complexity of actigraphy data to serve as a clinical biomarker for mortality risk.

Methods
We use detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to analyze actigraphy data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; n = 11,694). The DFA method measures fractal complexity (signal self-affinity across time-scales) as correlations between the amplitude of signal fluctuations in time-series data across a range of time-scales. The slope, Œ±, relating the fluctuation amplitudes to the time-scales over which they were measured describes the complexity of the signal.

Results
Fractal complexity of physical activity (Œ±) decreased significantly with age (p = 1.29E‚àí6) and was lower in women compared with men (p = 1.79E‚àí4). Higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in older adults and in women were associated with greater fractal complexity. In adults aged 50‚Äì79 years, lower fractal complexity of activity (Œ±) was associated with greater mortality (hazard ratio = 0.64; 95\% confidence interval = 0.49‚Äì0.82) after adjusting for age, exercise engagement, chronic diseases, and other covariates associated with mortality.

Conclusions
Wearable accelerometers can provide a noninvasive biomarker of physiological aging and mortality risk after adjusting for other factors strongly associated with mortality. Thus, this fractal analysis of accelerometer signals provides a novel clinical application for wearable accelerometers, advancing efforts for remote monitoring of physiological health by clinicians.},

Predicting the clinical outcomes of AATD-LD and defining patients more likely to progress to advanced liver disease are crucial for better understanding AATD-LD progression and promoting timely medical intervention. We aimed to develop a tailored machine learning (ML) model to predict the disease progression of AATD-LD. This analysis was conducted through a stacking ensemble learning model by combining five different ML algorithms with 58 predictor variables using nested five-fold cross-validation with repetitions based on the UK Biobank data. Performance of the model was assessed through prediction accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). The importance of predictor contributions was evaluated through a feature importance permutation method. The proposed stacking ensemble ML model showed clinically meaningful accuracy and appeared superior to any single ML algorithms in the ensemble, e.g., the AUROC for AATD-LD was 68.1\%, 75.9\%, 91.2\%, and 67.7\% for all-cause mortality, liver-related death, liver transplant, and all-cause mortality or liver transplant, respectively. This work supports the use of ML to address the unanswered clinical questions with clinically meaningful accuracy using real-world data.},

Disruption of circadian rhythm might be a risk factor for brain disorder incidents. From 7-day accelerometry data of 72,242 participants in UK Biobank, we derived a circadian relative amplitude variable, which to some extent reflected the degree of circadian rhythm disruption. Records of brain disorder incidents were obtained from a wide range of health outcomes across self-report, primary care, hospital inpatient data, and death data. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio regression, we created two models adjusting for different covariates. Then, linear correlations between relative amplitude and several brain morphometric measures were examined in participants with brain MRI data. After a median follow-up of around 6.1 years, 72,242 participants were included in the current study (female 54.9\%; mean age 62.1 years). Individuals with reduced relative amplitude had increasing risk of all-cause dementia (Hazard ratio 1.23 [95\% CI 1.15 to 1.31]), PD (1.33 [1.25 to 1.41]), stroke (1.13 [1.06 to 1.22]), MDD (1.18 [1.13 to 1.23]), and anxiety disorder (1.14 [1.09 to 1.20]) in fully adjusted models. Additionally, significant correlations were found between several cortical regions and white matter tracts and relative amplitude that have been linked to dementia and psychiatric disorders. We confirm CRD to be a risk factor for various brain disorders. Interventions for regulating circadian rhythm may have clinical relevance to reducing the risk of various brain disorders.},

The disruption of circadian rhythms may lead to adverse health outcomes. Evidence from recent population-based studies was reviewed because they represent real-world behavior and can be useful in developing future studies to reduce the risk of adverse health conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and diabetes mellitus, which may occur because of circadian disruption. An electronic search in PubMed and Web of Science (2012‚Äì2022) was performed. Selected articles were based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Five factors that may disrupt circadian rhythm alignment are discussed: shift work, late chronotype, late sleep timing, sleep irregularity, and late meal timing. Evidence from observational studies of these circadian disruptors suggests potential detrimental effects on cardiometabolic health, including higher BMI/obesity, higher blood pressure, greater dyslipidemia, greater inflammation, and diabetes. Future research should identify the specific underlying pathways in order to mitigate the health consequences of shift work. Furthermore, optimal sleep and mealtimes for metabolic health can be explored in intervention studies. Lastly, it is important that the timing of external environmental cues (such as light) and behaviors that influence circadian rhythms are managed.},

Objectives The aim of this study is to evaluate the implementation of a smartphone-based remote patient self-monitoring application in patients in the prodromal phase of RA and to create a predictive tool for the distinction of high-risk and low-risk patients.
Methods Individuals at risk for RA fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were recruited in a prospective 6-month trial: Proof of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), no clinically detectable synovial swelling at doctors visit, smartphone ownership. Participants were recruited from a prospective at-risk cohort and provided written consent (ethics-approval: 333\_16B and 21\_21B). All individuals were presented two standardized, self-produced educational videos about joint self-examination and pre-clinical RA and were informed about the remote monitoring option, using the CE-certified ABATON app. A new adaptive questionnaire-based algorithm ‚ÄúREMOTRA; REMote moniToring in pReclinical Arthritis‚Äù was developed including typical RA symptoms such as pain, swelling, morning stiffness and intake of pain medication. The criteria are weighted and added to a quantitative score from 0 to 15 pts. A cut-off value from 10 or more was defined as being highly symptomatic. The total number of questions varies depending on the answers given. Questionnaire frequency was based on shared-decision-making (every 7, 14 or 30 days). App usability and acceptance was measured using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Net Promoter Score (NPS). Routine clinical visits were scheduled on a regular basis every 3 months.
Results 79 patients were approached and 43 patients consented to participate (13 male; mean age: 49.3; 7-day/14-day/30-day interval: 3/15/25). Three patients (7\%) developed RA during the six months of study follow-up. Patient acceptance of the questionnaire decreased during the trial, from an NPS of 21.8 (47.8\% promoters) at 3 months down to 8.3 (45.8\% promoters) at six months. The education videos were well accepted with an NPS of 31.6 (joint self-examination; 57.9\% promoters) and 54.4 (Pre-RA; 63.6\% promoters). Questionnaire usability was continuously rated as high with an average SUS of 88.1/100 (SD: 5,5) at three months and 85.4/100 (SD: 16.0) at six months. The most frequently reported symptoms were joint pain (78.0\%, n=32), followed by joint swelling (73.2\%, n=30) and morning stiffness (43.9\%, n=18). 58.5\% (n=24) took analgesics and 29.3\% (n=12) took prednisolone at least once. Seven patients (16.3\%) reported no symptoms during the six months. None of the patients with a REMOTRA -Score {\textless}10 developed RA (negative predictive value: 100\%). However, patients with a score of 10 or more were diagnosed with a RA in their next consultation with a probability of 12\% (positive predictive value). Monitoring adherence was high with a mean of 4.6 (SD: 2.0) months app usage and 57.1\% completing all questionnaires.
Conclusion Our study shows that individuals at-risk for RA appreciate standardized digital disease education and mostly adhere to a telemedicine monitoring program. Remote self-monitoring sheds light on disease progress of at-risk patients. Further development and testing of this method may be worthwhile for a better informed and efficient utilization of limited in-person visit slots.

Sensing proteins in sweat, which would allow for point-of-care monitoring, is hindered by the typically large interpersonal and intrapersonal variations in its composition. Here we report the design and performance of a wearable and wireless patch for the real-time electrochemical detection of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive (CRP) protein in sweat. The device integrates iontophoretic sweat extraction, microfluidic channels for sweat sampling and for reagent routing and replacement, and a graphene-based sensor array for quantifying CRP (via an electrode functionalized with anti-CRP capture antibodies-conjugated gold nanoparticles), ionic strength, pH and temperature for the real-time calibration of the CRP sensor. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with active or past infections or who had heart failure, the elevated concentrations of CRP measured via the patch correlated well with the protein‚Äôs levels in serum. Wearable biosensors for the real-time sensitive analysis of inflammatory proteins in sweat may facilitate the management of chronic diseases.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES:

To provide guidelines for collecting and analyzing urinary, salivary, and plasma melatonin, thereby assisting clinicians and researchers in determining which method of measuring melatonin is most appropriate for their particular needs and facilitating the comparison of data between laboratories.

METHODS:

A modified RAND process was utilized to derive recommendations for methods of measuring melatonin in humans.

RESULTS:

Consensus-based guidelines are presented for collecting and analyzing melatonin for studies that are conducted in the natural living environment, the clinical setting, and in-patient research facilities under controlled conditions.

CONCLUSIONS:

The benefits and disadvantages of current methods of collecting and analyzing melatonin are summarized. Although a single method of analysis would be the most effective way to compare studies, limitations of current methods preclude this possibility. Given that the best analysis method for use under multiple conditions is not established, it is recommended to include, in any published report, one of the established low threshold measures of dim light melatonin onset to facilitate comparison between studies.

Salivary samples were collected and axillary temperature was measured every 2 h during two or three separate 26-h periods. The hormones were measured by radioimmunoassays. The rhythms were characterized with single cosinor analysis. Two subjects in group 1 and six subjects in group 2 had abnormalities in their rhythms of temperature, cortisol or melatonin. All three rhythms were disrupted in two subjects of group 2. These two subjects were the only ones with disrupted cortisol rhythm. The diversity of rhythm pathologies suggested partly separate regulatory mechanisms for each rhythm. The co-occurrence of circadian rhythm sleep disorders with the deteriorated melatonin rhythm raised the question as to whether the sleep disorders of these subjects, like those of subjects with healthy brains, could be relieved by the induction of normal melatonin rhythm.},

This study examined the characteristics of these rhythms in 31 healthy human subjects 20 to 30 years of age. They were synchronized with a diurnal activity from 0800 to 2300 and nocturnal rest. They participated in three 24-hour sessions (S1, S2, and S3): S2 took place two weeks after S1 and S3 4 weeks after S2. Blood samples were taken during each session at 3-hour intervals from 1100 to 2000 and hourly from 2200 to 0800. Comparison of the circadian rhythms between groups used repeated measures 2-way ANOVA, the cosinor method, and Bingham's test. Intraindividual variations were compared by the cosinor method and Bingham's test. The groups did not differ, but a slight difference in the amplitude or acrophase of individual circadian rhythms was observed in 5 of 31 subjects for melatonin and 1 of 31 for cortisol. The circadian means did not differ over the three sessions. These results show that the circadian profile of cortisol and melatonin are highly reproducible over a six-week period, in both individuals and groups. Our study clearly shows that these hormones can be considered to be stable markers of the circadian time structure and therefore useful tools to validate rhythms' synchronisation of human subjects.},

These mission durations will increase the risk for circadian misalignment. Exercise has gained increasing interest as a non-pharmacological aid to entrain the circadian system. To assess the potential of exercise as a countermeasure to mitigate the risk for circadian disorders during spaceflight, we investigated the effects of long-term head-down tilt bed rest (HDBR) with and without exercise on the circadian rhythm of core body temperature. Core body temperature was recorded for 24‚Äâh using a rectal probe in sixteen healthy men (age: 30.5‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ7.5 years (mean‚Äâ¬±‚ÄâSD)) after 7 days and 49 days of HDBR. Five participants underwent HDBR only (CTR), five participants underwent HDBR and performed resistive exercises (RE), and six participants underwent HDBR and performed resistive exercises superimposed with vibrations (RVE). The exercise was scheduled three times per week. CTR showed a phase delay of 0.69‚Äâh. In contrast, both exercise groups were characterized by a phase advance (0.45‚Äâh for RE and 0.45‚Äâh for RVE; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.026 for interaction between time and group). These findings suggest that resistive exercise (with or without vibration) may also serve as a countermeasure during spaceflight to mitigate circadian misalignments. The results could also be important for increasing awareness about the role of circadian disorders in long-term bedridden patients.},

This is essentially due to reduced day/night contrast, decreased sensitivity to light, napping and a more sedentary lifestyle. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop an algorithm to identify a SCR phenotype as belonging to young or aged subjects. To do this, 44 young and 44 aged subjects were recruited, and their distal skin temperature (DST), activity, body position, light, environmental temperature and the integrated variable TAP rhythms were recorded under free-living conditions for five consecutive workdays. Each variable yielded an individual decision tree to differentiate between young and elderly subjects (DST, activity, position, light, environmental temperature and TAP), with agreement rates of between 76.1\% (light) and 92\% (TAP). These decision trees were combined into a unique decision tree that reached an agreement rate of 95.3\% (4 errors out of 88, all of them around the cut-off point). Age-related SCR changes were very significant, thus allowing to discriminate accurately between young and aged people when implemented in decision trees. This is useful to identify chronodisrupted populations that could benefit from chronoenhancement strategies.},

The terms describing increasing mortality with age are multiplicative and additive, respectively, which could result from an increase in the vulnerability of individuals to extrinsic causes in the Gompertz model and the predominance of intrinsic causes at older ages in the Weibull model. Experiments that manipulate extrinsic mortality can distinguish these biological models. To facilitate analyses of experimental data, we defined a single index for the rate of aging (œâ) for the Weibull and Gompertz functions. Each function described the increase in aging-related mortality in simulated ages at death reasonably well. However, in contrast to the Weibull œâW, the Gompertz œâG was sensitive to variation in the initial mortality rate independently of aging-related mortality. Comparisons between wild and captive populations appear to support the intrinsic-causes model for birds, but give mixed support for both models in mammals.},

	abstract = {In 1825 the British actuary Benjamin Gompertz believed he had discovered a consistency in the timing of death in people that was so important that he labelled his observation a 'law of mortality'. To Gompertz, this 'law' was equivalent in importance to Newton's law of gravity because he believed it would be observed in all living things. Gompertz's quest for the 'law' eventually failed, as did similar efforts by other scientists in the 19th and most of the 20th century. However, the search for the law of mortality was successfully resolved in 1996 when my colleagues and I discovered that the only way to 'see' Gompertz's law expressed as common age patterns of death across species was to partition total mortality into its intrinsic and extrinsic components, and examine mortality schedules on a uniform time scale. Scientists had been unable to reveal the law of mortality in the past not only because they could not partition total mortality, but also because of the previous anthropocentric perspective that forced some scientists to view duration of life along a single time scale - one based on human measurements of chronological time. The law of mortality is relevant today not only because it links the epidemiology of disease, ageing and death across species, but because it creates a window into the future for those who study disease epidemiology in animals that now live long enough in protected environments to experience the biological consequences of ageing. In this paper I summarize the historical search for the law of mortality, explain why the solution could only be found by linking two seemingly unconnected scientific disciplines (evolution biology and actuarial/demographics), explain why age patterns of disease and death in humans may be used to understand and predict disease epidemiology in other species, and describe how a new scientific discipline has arisen in the modern era as a result of this research.},

	abstract = {There is great interest among gerontologists, demographers, and actuaries in the question concerning the limits to human longevity. Attempts at getting answers to this important question have stimulated many studies on late-life mortality trajectories, often with opposing conclusions. One group of researchers believes that mortality stops growing with age at extreme old ages, and that hence there is no fixed limit to the human life span. Other studies found that mortality continues to grow with age up to extreme old ages. Our study suggests a possible solution to this controversy. We found that mortality deceleration is best observed when older, less accurate life span data are analyzed, while in the case of more recent and reliable data there is a persistent mortality growth with age. We compared the performance (goodness of fit) of two competing mortality models ‚Äì the Gompertz model and the Kannisto (‚Äúmortality deceleration‚Äù) model ‚Äì at ages of 80‚Äì105 years using data for 1880‚Äì1899 single-year birth cohorts of US men and women. The mortality modeling approach suggests a transition from mortality deceleration to the Gompertzian mortality pattern over time for both men and women. These results are consistent with the hypothesis about disappearing mortality deceleration over time due to improvement in the accuracy of age reporting. In the case of more recent data, mortality continues to grow with age even at very old ages. This observation may lead to more conservative estimates of future human longevity records.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease that causes persistent and severe damage to the physical and mental health of patients. Daily effective prediction of epileptic seizures is crucial for epilepsy patients especially those with refractory epilepsy. At present, a large number of deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks have been used to predict epileptic seizures and have obtained better performance than traditional machine learning methods. However, these methods usually transform the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal into a Euclidean grid structure. The conversion suffers from loss of adjacent spatial information, which results in deep learning models requiring more storage and computational consumption in the process of information fusion after information extraction. This study proposes a general Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) model architecture for predicting seizures to solve the problem of oversized seizure prediction models based on exploring the graph structure of EEG signals. As a graph classification task, the network architecture includes graph convolution layers that extract node features with one-hop neighbors, pooling layers that summarize abstract node features; and fully connected layers that implement classification, resulting in superior prediction performance and smaller network size. The experiment shows that the model has an average sensitivity of 96.51\%, an average AUC of 0.92, and a model size of 15.5 k on 18 patients in the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset. Compared with traditional deep learning methods, which require a large number of parameters and computational effort and are demanding in terms of storage space and energy consumption, this method is more suitable for implementation on compact, low-power wearable devices as a standard process for building a generic low-consumption graph network model on similar biomedical signals. Furthermore, the edge features of graphs can be used to make a preliminary determination of locations and types of discharge, making it more clinically interpretable.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Sleep disturbances often co-occur with mood disorders, with poor sleep quality affecting over a quarter of the global population. Recent advances in sleep and circadian biology suggest poor sleep quality is linked to disruptions in circadian rhythms, including significant associations between sleep features and circadian clock gene variants.

Methods
Here, we employ machine learning techniques, combined with statistical approaches, in a deeply phenotyped population to explore associations between clock genotypes, circadian phenotypes (diurnal preference and circadian phase), and risk for sleep disturbance symptoms.

Results
As found in previous studies, evening chronotypes report high levels of sleep disturbance symptoms. Using molecular chronotyping by measuring circadian phase, we extend these findings and show that individuals with a mismatch between circadian phase and diurnal preference report higher levels of sleep disturbance. We also report novel synergistic interactions in genotype combinations of Period 3, Clock and Cryptochrome variants (PER3B (rs17031614)/ CRY1 (rs228716) and CLOCK3111 (rs1801260)/ CRY2 (rs10838524)) that yield strong associations with sleep disturbance, particularly in males.

Conclusion
Our results indicate that both direct and indirect mechanisms may impact sleep quality; sex-specific clock genotype combinations predictive of sleep disturbance may represent direct effects of clock gene function on downstream pathways involved in sleep physiology. In addition, the mediation of clock gene effects on sleep disturbance indicates circadian influences on the quality of sleep. Unraveling the complex molecular mechanisms at the intersection of circadian and sleep physiology is vital for understanding how genetic and behavioral factors influencing circadian phenotypes impact sleep quality. Such studies provide potential targets for further study and inform efforts to improve non-invasive therapeutics for sleep disorders.},

Molecular mechanisms underlying these connections may be direct‚Äîvia transcriptional activity of clock genes on downstream mood pathways in the brain, or indirect‚Äîvia clock gene influences on the phase and amplitude of circadian rhythms which, in turn, modulate physiological processes influencing mood. Employing machine learning combined with statistical approaches, we explored clock genotype combinations that predict risk for anxiety symptoms in a deeply phenotyped population. We identified multiple novel circadian genotypes predictive of anxiety, with the PER3(rs17031614)-AG/CRY1(rs2287161)-CG genotype being the strongest predictor of anxiety risk, particularly in males.¬†Molecular chronotyping,¬†using clock gene expression oscillations,¬†revealed that advanced circadian phase and robust circadian amplitudes are associated with high levels of anxiety symptoms. Further analyses revealed that individuals with advanced phases and pronounced¬†circadian misalignment were at higher risk for severe anxiety symptoms. Our results support¬†both direct and indirect influences of clock gene variants on mood: while sex-specific clock genotype combinations¬†predictive of anxiety symptoms suggest direct effects on mood pathways, the mediation of PER3 effects on anxiety via diurnal preference measures and the association of circadian phase with anxiety symptoms provide evidence for indirect effects of the molecular clockwork on mood. Unraveling the complex molecular mechanisms underlying the links between circadian physiology and mood is essential to identifying the core clock genes to target in future functional studies, thereby advancing the development of non-invasive treatments for anxiety-related disorders.},

Estimation of individual body time (circadian phase) is therefore highly relevant for individual optimization of behavior (sleep, meals, sports), diagnostic sampling, medical treatment, and for treatment of circadian rhythm disorders. Here, we provide a partial least squares regression (PLSR) machine learning approach that uses plasma-derived metabolomics data in one or more samples to estimate dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) as a proxy for circadian phase of the human body. For this purpose, our protocol was aimed to stay close to real-life conditions. We found that a metabolomics approach optimized for either women or men under entrained conditions performed equally well or better than existing approaches using more labor-intensive RNA sequencing-based methods. Although estimation of circadian body time using blood-targeted metabolomics requires further validation in shift work and other real-world conditions, it currently may offer a robust, feasible technique with relatively high accuracy to aid personalized optimization of behavior and clinical treatment after appropriate validation in patient populations.},

A prominent example is the circadian rhythm corresponding to the internalization by organisms of the \$24\$-hour period of the Earth's rotation. In this work, we study the emergence of circadian-like rhythms in deep reinforcement learning agents. In particular, we deployed agents in an environment with a reliable periodic variation while solving a foraging task. We systematically characterize the agent's behavior during learning and demonstrate the emergence of a rhythm that is endogenous and entrainable. Interestingly, the internal rhythm adapts to shifts in the phase of the environmental signal without any re-training. Furthermore, we show via bifurcation and phase response curve analyses how artificial neurons develop dynamics to support the internalization of the environmental rhythm. From a dynamical systems view, we demonstrate that the adaptation proceeds by the emergence of a stable periodic orbit in the neuron dynamics with a phase response that allows an optimal phase synchronisation between the agent's dynamics and the environmental rhythm.},

Yet, its physical activity (PA) intensity cutoff scores have not been established, making it less useful.

A total of 81 obese participants aged 10‚Äì17¬†years old (male¬†=¬†56\%) were recruited to perform one-minute warm-ups and walking or running at different speeds with ActiGraph on hips.

Linear and equipercentile equating were applied to the training sample to equate MIMS onto Count, creating MIMS-equated Count (MIMS-EQ-Count), a new MIMS-based unit. High correlation (‚â•.84), high agreements ({\textgreater}.7) and kappas (mostly {\textgreater}.5) between MIMS-EQ-Count and the Count in both training and testing samples under both linear and equipercentile methods. Equipercentile was the best equating method because of smaller standard errors. Yielded from equipercentile equating, a table linking MIMS and MIMS-EQ-Count was constructed, from which MIMS was linked and cross-validated with the well-studied Count. MIMS can now use the rich information accumulated for the Count of ActiGraph.},

	abstract = {IntroductionAccelerometry has become increasingly prevalent to monitor physical activity due to its low participant burden, quantitative metrics, and ease of deployment. Physical activity metrics are ideal for extracting intuitive, continuous measures of participants‚Äô health from multiple days or weeks of high frequency data due to their fairly straightforward computation. Previously, we released an open-source digital health python processing package, SciKit Digital Health (SKDH), with the goal of providing a unifying device-agnostic framework for multiple digital health algorithms, such as activity, gait, and sleep.MethodsIn this paper, we present the open-source SKDH implementation for the derivation of activity endpoints from accelerometer data. In this implementation, we include some non-typical features that have shown promise in providing additional context to activity patterns, and provide comparisons to existing algorithms, namely GGIR and the GENEActiv macros. Following this reference comparison, we investigate the association between age and derived physical activity metrics in a healthy adult cohort collected in the Pfizer Innovation Research Lab, comprising 7‚Äì14 days of at-home data collected from younger (18‚Äì40 years) and older (65‚Äì85 years) healthy volunteers.ResultsResults showed that activity metrics derived with SKDH had moderate to excellent ICC values (0.550 to 1.0 compared to GGIR, 0.469 to 0.697 compared to the GENEActiv macros), with high correlations for almost all compared metrics ({\textgreater}0.733 except vs GGIR sedentary time, 0.547). Several features show age-group differences, with Cohen‚Äôs d effect sizes {\textgreater}1.0 and p-values‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001. These features included non-threshold methods such as intensity gradient, and activity fragmentation features such as between-states transition probabilities.DiscussionThese results demonstrate the validity of the implemented SKDH physical activity algorithm, and the potential of the implemented PA metrics in assessing activity changes in free-living conditions.},

Raw accelerometry data from a total of 40 devices (i.e., n=10 ActiGraph wGT3X-BT, n=10 Apple Watch Series 7, n=10 Garmin Vivoactive 4S, and n=10 Fitbit Sense) were compared to the criterion accelerations produced by an orbital shaker table at speeds ranging from 0.6 Hz (4.4 milligravity-mg) to 3.2 Hz (124.7mg). For reliability testing, identical devices were oscillated at 0.6 and 3.2 Hz for 5 trials that lasted 2 minutes each. For validity testing, devices were oscillated for 1 trial across 7 speeds that lasted 2 minutes each. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to test inter-device reliability. Pearson product moment, Lin‚Äôs concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), absolute error, and mean bias were calculated to assess the validity between the raw estimates from the devices and the criterion metric. Estimates produced by the raw accelerometry data from Apple and ActiGraph were more reliable ICCs=0.99 and 0.97 than Garmin and Fitbit ICCs=0.88 and 0.88, respectively. Estimates from ActiGraph, Apple, and Fitbit devices exhibited excellent concordance with the criterion CCCs=0.88, 0.83, and 0.85, respectively, while estimates from Garmin exhibited moderate concordance CCC=0.59 based on the mean aggregation method. ActiGraph, Apple, and Fitbit produced similar absolute errors=16.9mg, 21.6mg, and 22.0mg, respectively, while Garmin produced higher absolute error=32.5mg compared to the criterion based on the mean aggregation method. ActiGraph produced the lowest mean bias 0.0mg (95\%CI=-40.0, 41.0) based on the mean aggregation method. Raw accelerometry data collected from Apple and Fitbit are comparable to ActiGraph. However, raw accelerometry data from Garmin appears to be different.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sleep and circadian disruption are associated with depression onset and severity, but it is unclear which features (e.g., sleep duration, chronotype) are important and whether they can identify individuals showing poorer outcomes.
METHODS: Within a subset of the UK Biobank with actigraphy and mental health data (n¬†=¬†64,353), penalised regression identified the most useful of 51 sleep/rest-activity predictors of depression-related outcomes; including case-control (Major Depression (MD) vs. controls; postnatal depression vs. controls) and within-case comparisons (severe vs. moderate MD; early vs. later onset, atypical vs. typical symptoms; comorbid anxiety; suicidality). Best models (of lasso, ridge, and elastic net) were selected based on Area Under the Curve (AUC).
RESULTS: For MD vs. controls (n(MD)¬†=¬†24,229; n(control)¬†=¬†40,124), lasso AUC was 0.68, 95¬†\% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.69. Discrimination was reasonable for atypical vs. typical symptoms (n(atypical)¬†=¬†958; n(typical)¬†=¬†18,722; ridge: AUC 0.74, 95¬†\% CI 0.71-0.77) but poor for remaining models (AUCs 0.59-0.67). Key predictors across most models included: difficulty getting up, insomnia symptoms, snoring, actigraphy-measured daytime inactivity and lower morning activity ({\textasciitilde}8¬†am). In a distinct subset (n¬†=¬†310,718), the number of these factors shown was associated with all depression outcomes.
LIMITATIONS: Analyses were cross-sectional and in middle-/older aged adults: comparison with longitudinal investigations and younger cohorts is necessary.
DISCUSSION: Sleep and circadian measures alone provided poor to moderate discrimination of depression outcomes, but several characteristics were identified that may be clinically useful. Future work should assess these features alongside broader sociodemographic, lifestyle and genetic features.},

	abstract = {Disrupted circadian rhythms have been linked to an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. However, many studies show inconsistent findings and are not sufficiently powered for targeted subgroup analyses. Using the UK Biobank cohort, we evaluate the association between circadian rhythm-disrupting behaviours, blood pressure (SBP, DBP) and inflammatory markers in {\textgreater}350,000 adults with European white British ancestry. The independent U-shaped relationship between sleep length and SBP/DBP is most prominent with a low inflammatory status. Poor sleep quality and permanent night shift work are also positively associated with SBP/DBP. Although fully adjusting for BMI in the linear regression model attenuated effect sizes, these associations remain significant. Two-sample Mendelian Randomisation (MR) analyses support a potential causal effect of long sleep, short sleep, chronotype, daytime napping and sleep duration on SBP/DBP. Thus, in the current study, we present a positive association between circadian rhythm-disrupting behaviours and SBP/DBP regulation in males and females that is largely independent of age.},

	abstract = {Evidence regarding the association between physical activity and Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) risk is generally limited due to the use of self-report questionnaires. We aimed to quantify the separate and combined effects of accelerometer-measured light physical activity (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sedentary time and exercise timing with incident PD. 96,422 participants without prior PD and with usable accelerometer data were included from UK Biobank. Time spent in sedentary activity, LPA, MVPA, and exercise timing were estimated using machine learning models. The study outcome was incident PD. Over a median follow-up duration of 6.8 years, 313 participants developed PD. There was a L-shaped association for LPA and MVPA, and a reversed L-shaped association for sedentary time, with the risk of incident PD (all P for nonlinearity‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001). Similar trends were found across three time-windows (morning, midday-afternoon, and evening). Compared with those with both low LPA ({\textless}3.89‚Äâh/day) and low MVPA ({\textless}0.27‚Äâh/day), the adjusted HR (95\% CI) of PD risk was 0.49 (0.36‚Äì0.66), 0.19 (0.36‚Äì0.66) and 0.13 (0.09‚Äì0.18), respectively, for participants with high MVPA only, high LPA only, and both high LPA and high MVPA. Moreover, participants with both low LPA and high sedentary time (‚â•9.41‚Äâh/day) (adjusted HR, 5.59; 95\% CI: 4.10‚Äì7.61), and those with both low MVPA and high sedentary time (adjusted HR, 3.93; 95\% CI: 2.82‚Äì5.49) had the highest risk of incident PD.

The use of modern technologies can potentially further improve the success of these interventions, promote metabolic health, and prevent T2D at scale. To test this concept, we built a remote program that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and wearables to make lifestyle recommendations that improve health. We enrolled 2,217 participants with varying degrees of glucose levels (normal range, and prediabetes and T2D ranges), using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) over 28‚Äâdays to capture glucose patterns. Participants logged food intake, physical activity, and body weight via a smartphone app that integrated wearables data and provided daily insights, including overlaying glucose patterns with activity and food intake, macronutrient breakdown, glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and activity measures. The app furthermore provided personalized recommendations based on users‚Äô preferences, goals, and observed glycemic patterns. Users could interact with the app for an additional 2‚Äâmonths without CGM. Here we report significant improvements in hyperglycemia, glucose variability, and hypoglycemia, particularly in those who were not diabetic at baseline. Body weight decreased in all groups, especially those who were overweight or obese. Healthy eating habits improved significantly, with reduced daily caloric intake and carbohydrate-to-calorie ratio and increased intake of protein, fiber, and healthy fats relative to calories. These findings suggest that lifestyle recommendations, in addition to behavior logging and CGM data integration within a mobile app, can enhance the metabolic health of both nondiabetic and T2D individuals, leading to healthier lifestyle choices. This technology can be a valuable tool for T2D prevention and treatment.},

          Circadian rhythms are important regulators of immune functions. Admission to an intensive care unit may impact molecular clock activity and host response. Our objective was to assess and compare the immune circadian rhythms in trauma patients who develop and in those who do not develop sepsis.
          Methods:¬†
          Blood samples were collected from severe trauma patients within 4 days after admission, with collections taking place every 4 h over a 24-h period. Cortisol and cytokines were measured with immunoassays. Whole-blood expression of 3 clock genes (Bmal1, Per2, and Per3) was studied by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Patients with and without sepsis were compared with the cosinor mixed model to estimate mesors, amplitudes, and acrophases.
          Results:¬†
          Thirty-eight patients were enrolled in the study, and 13 developed at least 1 septic episode. The septic patients had higher levels of cortisol than the nonseptic patients (mesor at 489 nmol/L vs. 405 nmol/L, P {\textless} 0.05) and delayed acrophases (22 h vs. 15 h, P {\textless} 0.05). They also had lower lymphocyte counts (mesor at 785 vs. 1,012 cells/ŒºL, P {\textless} 0.05), higher neutrophil counts (mesor at 7,648 vs. 7,001 cells/ŒºL, P {\textless} 0.05), and monocyte counts (mesor at 579 vs. 473 cells/ŒºL, P {\textless} 0.05) than the nonseptic patients. Although no amplitude difference was identified, the acrophases were significantly different between the 2 groups for lymphocytes, interleukin 10 and tumor necrosis factor.
          Conclusion:¬†
          We demonstrated that all trauma patients had impaired circadian rhythms of cortisol, cytokines, leukocytes, and clock genes. Early circadian disruption was associated with the occurrence of sepsis and might be a marker of sepsis severity.},

	abstract = {Background
Disruption of sleep and circadian rhythmicity is a core feature of mood disorders and might be associated with increased susceptibility to such disorders. Previous studies in this area have used subjective reports of activity and sleep patterns, but the availability of accelerometer-based data from UK Biobank participants permits the derivation and analysis of new, objectively ascertained circadian rhythmicity parameters. We examined associations between objectively assessed circadian rhythmicity and mental health and wellbeing phenotypes, including lifetime history of mood disorder.
Methods
UK residents aged 37‚Äì73 years were recruited into the UK Biobank general population cohort from 2006 to 2010. We used data from a subset of participants whose activity levels were recorded by wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer for 7 days. From these data, we derived a circadian relative amplitude variable, which is a measure of the extent to which circadian rhythmicity of rest‚Äìactivity cycles is disrupted. In the same sample, we examined cross-sectional associations between low relative amplitude and mood disorder, wellbeing, and cognitive variables using a series of regression models. Our final model adjusted for age and season at the time that accelerometry started, sex, ethnic origin, Townsend deprivation score, smoking status, alcohol intake, educational attainment, overall mean acceleration recorded by accelerometry, body-mass index, and a binary measure of childhood trauma.
Findings
We included 91‚Äà105 participants with accelerometery data collected between 2013 and 2015 in our analyses. A one-quintile reduction in relative amplitude was associated with increased risk of lifetime major depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR] 1¬∑06, 95\% CI 1¬∑04‚Äì1¬∑08) and lifetime bipolar disorder (1¬∑11, 1¬∑03‚Äì1¬∑20), as well as with greater mood instability (1¬∑02, 1¬∑01‚Äì1¬∑04), higher neuroticism scores (incident rate ratio 1¬∑01, 1¬∑01‚Äì1¬∑02), more subjective loneliness (OR 1¬∑09, 1¬∑07‚Äì1¬∑11), lower happiness (0¬∑91, 0¬∑90‚Äì0¬∑93), lower health satisfaction (0¬∑90, 0¬∑89‚Äì0¬∑91), and slower reaction times (linear regression coefficient 1¬∑75, 1¬∑05‚Äì2¬∑45). These associations were independent of demographic, lifestyle, education, and overall activity confounders.
Interpretation
Circadian disruption is reliably associated with various adverse mental health and wellbeing outcomes, including major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Lower relative amplitude might be linked to increased susceptibility to mood disorders.

We examined the relationship between sleep regularity and risk of all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality in 88,975 participants from the prospective UK Biobank cohort.The sleep regularity index (SRI) was calculated as the probability of an individual being in the same state (asleep or awake) at any two time points 24 hours apart, averaged over 7-days of accelerometry (range 0-100, with 100 being perfectly regular). The SRI was related to the risk of mortality in time-to-event models.The mean sample age was 62 years (SD, 8), 56\% were women, and the median SRI was 60 (SD, 10). There were 3010 deaths during a mean follow-up of 7.1 years. Following adjustments for demographic and clinical variables, we identified a non-linear relationship between the SRI and all-cause mortality hazard (p [global test of spline term] {\textless} 0¬∑001). Hazard Ratios, relative to the median SRI, were 1¬∑53 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1¬∑41, 1¬∑66) for participants with SRI at the 5th percentile (SRI = 41) and 0¬∑90 (95\% CI: 0¬∑81, 1¬∑00) for those with SRI at the 95th percentile (SRI = 75), respectively.

To examine the associations of disrupted circadian rest-activity rhythm (CRAR) with cardiovascular diseases and mortality among people with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
A total of 3147 participants with baseline type 2 diabetes (mean age 65.21 years, 39.78\% female; mean HbA1c 50.02 mmol/mol) from UK Biobank were included. The following CRAR parameters were derived from acceleration data: interdaily stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV), relative amplitude (RA), most active 10 h period onset (M10 onset), and least active 5 h period onset (L5 onset). We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the associations of CRAR with cardiovascular diseases and mortality, adjusting for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health characteristics.
Results
Participants in the lowest quartile of IS and RA exhibited the greatest risk of developing cardiovascular disease (IS, hazard ratio [HR]Q1 vs. Q4 1.40 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.04, 1.88]; RA, HRQ1 vs. Q4 2.45 [95\% CI 1.73, 3.49]). However, the association between delayed L5 onset and cardiovascular disease risk did not reach statistical significance. Additionally, we found that high IV and low RA were associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
Conclusion
Objectively determined CRAR disturbances may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and mortality among people with type 2 diabetes.},

The daily physical activity data were fitted to a cosine curve to estimate the peak phase (acrophase), and the difference in the peak phase (time) for each day was determined. The standard deviation (SD) of the mean peak phase differences over 6 days was obtained. The higher the SD value, the more disturbed the circadian rhythm of activity. Based on the calculated values, the samples were divided into tertiles (small, medium, and large). A significant positive correlation was found between Log SD and body fat percentage on the disruption of circadian activity rhythms and obesity-related indices. In addition, positive associations were observed among body mass, body mass index, and Log SD. However, these associations were not observed in women.

A wearable accelerometer- based sensor network was used for ambulatory monitoring of participants‚Äô circadian rhythm based on physical activity. Acceleration signals collected from the portable accelerometers were processed by circadian rhythm estimation algorithms including: sleep/wake cycle analysis, Cosinor analysis, and Poincar√© plot analysis. From an analysis of the indices generated by the proposed circadian rhythm estimation algorithms, we conclude that significant differences exist in circadian rhythms among various chronotypes. In addition, according to our analysis, we conclude that chronotype does indeed influence circadian rhythms, with the most significant difference observed for sleep midpoint.

	abstract = {Background: Wearables have been gaining increasing momentum and have enormous potential to provide insights into daily life behaviors and longitudinal health monitoring. However, to date, there is still a lack of principled algorithmic framework to facilitate the analysis of actigraphy and objectively characterize day-by-day data patterns, particularly in cohorts with sleep problems.
Objective: This study aimed to propose a principled algorithmic framework for the assessment of activity, sleep, and circadian rhythm patterns in people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental disorder with long-lasting distressing symptoms such as intrusive memories, avoidance behaviors, and sleep disturbance. In clinical practice, these symptoms are typically assessed using retrospective self-reports that are prone to recall bias. The aim of this study was to develop objective measures from patients‚Äô everyday lives, which could potentially considerably enhance the understanding of symptoms, behaviors, and treatment effects.
Methods: Using a wrist-worn sensor, we recorded actigraphy, light, and temperature data over 7 consecutive days from three groups: 42 people diagnosed with PTSD, 43 traumatized controls, and 30 nontraumatized controls. The participants also completed a daily sleep diary over 7 days and the standardized Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. We developed a novel approach to automatically determine sleep onset and offset, which can also capture awakenings that are crucial for assessing sleep quality. Moreover, we introduced a new intuitive methodology facilitating actigraphy exploration and characterize day-by-day data across 49 activity, sleep, and circadian rhythm patterns.
Results: We demonstrate that the new sleep detection algorithm closely matches the sleep onset and offset against the participants' sleep diaries consistently outperforming an existing open-access widely used approach. Participants with PTSD exhibited considerably more fragmented sleep patterns (as indicated by greater nocturnal activity, including awakenings) and greater intraday variability compared with traumatized and nontraumatized control groups, showing statistically significant (P\&lt;.05) and strong associations ({\textbar}R{\textbar}\&gt;0.3).
Conclusions: This study lays the foundation for objective assessment of activity, sleep, and circadian rhythm patterns using passively collected data from a wrist-worn sensor, facilitating large community studies to monitor longitudinally healthy and pathological cohorts under free-living conditions. These findings may be useful in clinical PTSD assessment and could inform therapy and monitoring of treatment effects.},

	abstract = {Chronic pain is currently diagnosed using verbal self-reports, which present a challenge for patients with cognitive or physiological disorders. Prior work has explored machine learning prediction of pain from clinical data, which requires active user involvement and does not capture their behavior in natural settings. Passive objective assessment is desirable. Circadian Rhythms, including sleep‚Äìwake cycles, are biological processes that reoccur every 24¬†h and can be derived from physiological data such as heart rate, activity, and sleep, gathered using widely-owned smart wearables. This study investigated the feasibility of using machine learning and rest-activity circadian rhythm features to predict patients‚Äô pain, including pain intensity, its interference with the patient‚Äôs life (dysregulation), and their difficulty in performing physical functions using passively gathered actigraphy data. To predict pain on day N, actigraphy data collected over that day were analyzed. Three sets of feature were extracted: (1) Activity (total sedentary bouts/time/breaks, \% in sedentary/light/ moderate activity), (2) Sleep (sleep efficiency/latency, wake after sleep onset), and (3) Rest Activity Rhythm (mesor, acrophase, Intradaily Variability (IV)). These features were then classified using various machine learning algorithms. Our proposed PainRhythms approach achieved an average AUC-ROC of 0.97 with a stacking machine learning classifier for predicting pain, 0.67 and 0.62 with logistic regression for pain intensity and interference, and 0.56 with gradient boosting for physical function. We found that chronic pain predictions were more accurate using rest-activity rhythm features than sleep or activity features. Of all the rhythmic features, Intradaily Variability (IV) was the most predictive feature, with elevated values in pain associated with disturbed sleep. PainRhythms provides preliminary evidence that rest-activity rhythms can effectively detect subjects with chronic pain. In future work, we aim to gather more data and confirm our preliminary findings on a large, class-balanced and diverse dataset.},

	abstract = {Advanced Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) is characterized by motor fluctuations including unpredictable oscillations remarkably impairing quality of life. Effective management and development of novel therapies for these response fluctuations largely depend on clinical rating instruments such as the widely-used PD home diary, which are associated with biases and errors. Recent advancements in digital health technologies provide user-friendly wearables that can be tailored for continuous monitoring of motor fluctuations. Their criterion validity under real-world conditions using clinical examination as the gold standard remains to be determined. We prospectively examined this validity of a wearable accelerometer-based digital Parkinson‚Äôs Motor Diary (adPMD) using the Parkinson‚Äôs Kinetigraph (PKG¬Æ) in an alternative application by converting its continuous data into one of the three motor categories of the PD home diary (Off, On and Dyskinetic state). Sixty-three out of 91 eligible participants with fluctuating PD (46\% men, average age 66) had predefined sufficient adPMD datasets ({\textgreater}70\% of half-hour periods) from 2 consecutive days. 92\% of per-protocol assessments were completed. adPMD monitoring of daily times in motor states showed moderate validity for Off and Dyskinetic state (ICC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.43‚Äì0.51), while inter-rating methods agreements on half-hour-level can be characterized as poor (median Cohen‚Äôs Œ∫‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.13‚Äì0.21). Individualization of adPMD thresholds for transferring accelerometer data into diary categories improved temporal agreements up to moderate level for Dyskinetic state detection (median Cohen‚Äôs Œ∫‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.25‚Äì0.41). Here we report that adPMD real-world-monitoring captures daily times in Off and Dyskinetic state in advanced PD with moderate validities, while temporal agreement of adPMD and clinical observer diary data is limited.},

	abstract = {Background:
Increasing evidence suggests an association between both short and long duration of habitual sleep with adverse health outcomes.

Objectives:
To assess whether the population longitudinal evidence supports the presence of a relationship between duration of sleep and all-cause mortality, to investigate both short and long sleep duration and to obtain an estimate of the risk.

Methods:
We performed a systematic search of publications using MEDLINE (1966-2009), EMBASE (from 1980), the Cochrane Library, and manual searches without language restrictions. We included studies if they were prospective, had follow-up {\textgreater}3 years, had duration of sleep at baseline, and all-cause mortality prospectively. We extracted relative risks (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and pooled them using a random effect model. We carried out sensitivity analyses and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias.

Results:
Overall, the 16 studies analyzed provided 27 independent cohort samples. They included 1,382,999 male and female participants (follow-up range 4 to 25 years), and 112,566 deaths. Sleep duration was assessed by questionnaire and outcome through death certification. In the pooled analysis, short duration of sleep was associated with a greater risk of death (RR: 1.12; 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.18; P {\textless} 0. 01) with no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.74) but heterogeneity between studies (P = 0.02). Long duration of sleep was also associated with a greater risk of death (1.30; [1.22 to 1.38]; P {\textless} 0.0001) with no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.18) but significant heterogeneity between studies (P {\textless} 0.0001).

Conclusion:
Both short and long duration of sleep are significant predictors of death in prospective population studies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Digital technologies are increasingly integrating into people's daily living environments such as schools, sport clubs, and health care facilities. These settings play a crucial role for health promotion and prevention because they affect the health of their members, as the World Health Organization has declared. Implementing digital health promotion and prevention in settings offers the opportunity to reach specific target groups, lower the costs of implementation, and improve the health of the population. Currently, there is a lack of scientific evidence that reviews the research on digital health promotion and prevention in settings.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to provide an overview of research targeting digital health promotion and primary prevention in settings. It assesses the range of scientific literature regarding outcomes such as applied technology, targeted setting, and area of health promotion or prevention, as well as identifies research gaps.
METHODS: The scoping review was conducted following the Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien framework. We searched scientific databases and gray literature for articles on digital setting-based health promotion and prevention published from 2010 to January 2020. We included empirical and nonempirical publications in English or German and excluded secondary or tertiary prevention and health promotion at the workplace.
RESULTS: From 8888 records, the search resulted in 200 (2.25\%) included publications. We identified a huge diversity of literature regarding digital setting-based health promotion and prevention. The variety of technology types extends from computer- and web-based programs to mobile devices (eg, smartphone apps) and telemonitoring devices (sensors). We found analog, digital, and blended settings in which digital health promotion and prevention takes place. The most frequent analog settings were schools (39/200, 19.5\%) and neighborhoods or communities (24/200, 12\%). Social media apps were also included because in some studies they were defined as a (digital) setting. They accounted for 31.5\% (63/200) of the identified settings. The most commonly focused areas of health promotion and prevention were physical activity (81/200, 40.5\%), nutrition (45/200, 22.5\%), and sexual health (34/200, 17\%). Most of the interventions combined several health promotion or prevention methods, including environmental change; providing information, social support, training, or incentives; and monitoring. Finally, we found that the articles mostly reported on behavioral rather than structural health promotion and prevention.
CONCLUSIONS: The research field of digital health promotion and prevention in settings is heterogeneous. At the same time, we identified research gaps regarding the absence of valid definitions of relevant terms (eg, digital settings) and the lack of literature on structural health promotion and prevention in settings. Therefore, it remains unclear how digital technologies can contribute to structural (or organizational) changes in settings. More research is needed to successfully implement digital technologies to achieve health promotion and prevention in settings.},

	abstract = {There is considerable epidemiological evidence that shift work is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, perhaps the result of physiologic maladaptation to chronically sleeping and eating at abnormal circadian times. To begin to understand underlying mechanisms, we determined the effects of such misalignment between behavioral cycles (fasting/feeding and sleep/wake cycles) and endogenous circadian cycles on metabolic, autonomic, and endocrine predictors of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk. Ten adults (5 female) underwent a 10-day laboratory protocol, wherein subjects ate and slept at all phases of the circadian cycle‚Äîachieved by scheduling a recurring 28-h ‚Äúday.‚Äù Subjects ate 4 isocaloric meals each 28-h ‚Äúday.‚Äù For 8 days, plasma leptin, insulin, glucose, and cortisol were measured hourly, urinary catecholamines 2 hourly (totaling ‚âà1,000 assays/subject), and blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac vagal modulation, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio, and polysomnographic sleep daily. Core body temperature was recorded continuously for 10 days to assess circadian phase. Circadian misalignment, when subjects ate and slept ‚âà12 h out of phase from their habitual times, systematically decreased leptin (‚àí17\%, P {\textless} 0.001), increased glucose (+6\%, P {\textless} 0.001) despite increased insulin (+22\%, P = 0.006), completely reversed the daily cortisol rhythm (P {\textless} 0.001), increased mean arterial pressure (+3\%, P = 0.001), and reduced sleep efficiency (‚àí20\%, P {\textless} 0.002). Notably, circadian misalignment caused 3 of 8 subjects (with sufficient available data) to exhibit postprandial glucose responses in the range typical of a prediabetic state. These findings demonstrate the adverse cardiometabolic implications of circadian misalignment, as occurs acutely with jet lag and chronically with shift work.},

	abstract = {Background: Technological advancements, together with the decrease in both price and size of a large variety of sensors, has expanded the role and capabilities of regular mobile phones, turning them into powerful yet ubiquitous monitoring systems. At present, smartphones have the potential to continuously collect information about the users, monitor their activities and behaviors in real time, and provide them with feedback and recommendations. Objective: This systematic review aimed to identify recent scientific studies that explored the passive use of smartphones for generating health- and well-being‚Äìrelated outcomes. In addition, it explores users‚Äô engagement and possible challenges in using such self-monitoring systems. Methods: A systematic review was conducted, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, to identify recent publications that explore the use of smartphones as ubiquitous health monitoring systems. We ran reproducible search queries on PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Scopus online databases and aimed to find answers to the following questions: (1) What is the study focus of the selected papers? (2) What smartphone sensing technologies and data are used to gather health-related input? (3) How are the developed systems validated? and (4) What are the limitations and challenges when using such sensing systems? Results: Our bibliographic research returned 7404 unique publications. Of these, 118 met the predefined inclusion criteria, which considered publication dates from 2014 onward, English language, and relevance for the topic of this review. The selected papers highlight that smartphones are already being used in multiple health-related scenarios. Of those, physical activity (29.6\%; 35/118) and mental health (27.9; 33/118) are 2 of the most studied applications. Accelerometers (57.7\%; 67/118) and global positioning systems (GPS; 40.6\%; 48/118) are 2 of the most used sensors in smartphones for collecting data from which the health status or well-being of its users can be inferred. Conclusions: One relevant outcome of this systematic review is that although smartphones present many advantages for the passive monitoring of users‚Äô health and well-being, there is a lack of correlation between smartphone-generated outcomes and clinical knowledge. Moreover, user engagement and motivation are not always modeled as prerequisites, which directly affects user adherence and full validation of such systems.},

Since chronic patients rely on life-long healthcare systems and the current COVID-19 pandemic has placed limits on hospital care, there is a need to explore disease monitoring and management technologies and examine their acceptance by chronic patients. We systematically examined the use of smartphone applications (apps) in chronic disease monitoring and management in databases, namely, Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and Proquest, published from 2010 to 2020. Results showed that app-based weight management programs had a significant effect on healthy eating and physical activity (p = 0.002), eating behaviours (p {\textless} 0.001) and dietary intake pattern (p {\textless} 0.001), decreased mean body weight (p = 0.008), mean Body Mass Index (BMI) (p = 0.002) and mean waist circumference (p {\textless} 0.001). App intervention assisted in decreasing the stress levels (paired t-test = 3.18; p {\textless} 0.05). Among cancer patients, we observed a high acceptance of technology (76\%) and a moderately positive correlation between non-invasive electronic monitoring data and questionnaire (r = 0.6, p {\textless} 0.0001). We found a significant relationship between app use and standard clinical evaluation and high acceptance of the use of apps to monitor the disease. Our findings provide insights into critical issues, including technology acceptance along with regulatory guidelines to be considered when designing, developing, and deploying smartphone solutions targeted for chronic patients.},

Wearables, equipped with various sensing technologies (e.g., accelerometer for movement, optics for heart rate), are increasingly being recognised for their expansive potential in (remote) patient monitoring, diagnostics, and therapeutic applications which suggests a plausible move towards a more decentralised healthcare system. This shift is evident as healthcare providers and patients alike are becoming increasingly accepting of wearable-driven tools, as they enable continuous health monitoring outside of traditional clinical settings. Equally, the ubiquitous nature of smartphones, now more than mere communication tools, is being harnessed to serve as pivotal health monitoring instruments. Their added sensing capabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) driven connectivity enable a (relatively) seamless transition from conventional health practices to a more interconnected, digital age. However, this evolving landscape is not without its challenges, with concerns surrounding data privacy, security, and ensuring equitable access to digital advances. As we delve deeper into digital healthcare, we must harness the full potential of those technologies and ensure their ethical and equitable implementation, envisioning a future where healthcare is not just hospital-centric but is part of our daily lives.},

(2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model‚Äôs performance over time.

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/bti171},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Given the joint feature-label distribution, increasing the number of features always results in decreased classification error; however, this is not the case when a classifier is designed via a classification rule from sample data. Typically (but not always), for fixed sample size, the error of a designed classifier decreases and then increases as the number of features grows. The potential downside of using too many features is most critical for small samples, which are commonplace for gene-expression-based classifiers for phenotype discrimination. For fixed sample size and feature-label distribution, the issue is to find an optimal number of features.
RESULTS: Since only in rare cases is there a known distribution of the error as a function of the number of features and sample size, this study employs simulation for various feature-label distributions and classification rules, and across a wide range of sample and feature-set sizes. To achieve the desired end, finding the optimal number of features as a function of sample size, it employs massively parallel computation. Seven classifiers are treated: 3-nearest-neighbor, Gaussian kernel, linear support vector machine, polynomial support vector machine, perceptron, regular histogram and linear discriminant analysis. Three Gaussian-based models are considered: linear, nonlinear and bimodal. In addition, real patient data from a large breast-cancer study is considered. To mitigate the combinatorial search for finding optimal feature sets, and to model the situation in which subsets of genes are co-regulated and correlation is internal to these subsets, we assume that the covariance matrix of the features is blocked, with each block corresponding to a group of correlated features. Altogether there are a large number of error surfaces for the many cases. These are provided in full on a companion website, which is meant to serve as resource for those working with small-sample classification.

	abstract = {Depression and anxiety are among the most prevalent mental disorders, and they are usually interconnected. Although these mental disorders have drawn increasing attention due to their tremendous negative impacts on working ability and job performance, over 50\% of patients are not recognized or adequately treated. Recent literature has shown the potential of using wearables for expediting the detection of mental health disorders, as physical activities are reported to be related to some mental health disorders. However, most prior studies on mental health with wearables were limited to small cohorts. The feasibility of detecting mental disorders in the community with a large and diverse population remains an open question. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting depression and anxiety disorders with commercial wearable activity trackers based on a public dataset including 8,996 participants and 1,247 diagnosed with mental disorders. The large cohort is highly diverse, spanning a wide spectrum of age, race, ethnicity, and education levels. While prior studies were usually limited to shallow machine learning models and feature engineering to accommodate the small sample sizes, we develop an end-to-end deep model combining a transformer encoder and convolutional neural network to directly learn from daily wearable features and detect mental disorders. WearNet achieves an area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.717 (S.D. 0.009) and an AUPRC of 0.487 (S.D. 0.008) in detecting mental disorders while outperforming traditional and state-of-the-art machine learning models. This work demonstrates the feasibility and promise of using wearables to detect mental disorders in a large and diverse community.},

Two machine learning algorithms: gradient boosting decision tree and eXtreme gradient boosting were constructed using data on daytime physical activity, sedentary time and nighttime physiological functions, including heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, combined with subjective scale features. The accuracy, precision, recall, F1 value, and AUC of the different models are compared, and the training and model effectiveness are validated by the subject-based leave-one-out method.ResultsThe low physical activity state was higher in the MCI group than in the cognitively normal group between 8:00 and 11:00 (P {\textless} 0.05), the daily rhythm trend of the high physical activity state was generally lower in the MCI group than in the cognitively normal group (P {\textless} 0.05). The peak rhythms in the sedentary state appeared at 12:00‚Äì15:00 and 20:00. The peak rhythms of rMSSD, HRV high frequency output power, and HRV low frequency output power in the 6h HRV parameters at night in the MCI group disappeared at 3:00 a.m., and the amplitude of fluctuations decreased; the amplitude of fluctuations of LHratio nocturnal rhythm increased and the phase was disturbed; the oxygen saturation was between 90 and 95\% and less than 90\% were increased in all time periods (P {\textless} 0.05). The F1 value of the two machine learning algorithms for MCI classification of multi-feature data combined with subjective scales were XGBoost (78.02) and GBDT (84.04).ConclusionBy collecting PSQI Scale data combined with circadian rhythm characteristics monitored by wrist-wearable sensors, we are able to construct XGBoost and GBDT machine learning models with good discrimination, thus providing an early warning solution for identifying family and community members with high risk of MCI.},

The workshop brought together experts in consumer sleep technologies and medical devices, sleep and circadian physiology, clinical translational research, and clinical practice. The goals of the workshop were: (1) characterize the term "wearable" for use in sleep and circadian science and identify relevant sleep and circadian metrics for wearables to measure; (2) assess the current use of wearables in sleep and circadian science; (3) identify current barriers for applying wearables to sleep and circadian science; and (4) identify goals and opportunities for wearables to advance sleep and circadian science. For the purposes of biomarker development in the sleep and circadian fields, the workshop included the terms "wearables," "nearables," and "ingestibles." Given the state of the current science and technology, the limited validation of wearable devices against gold standard measurements is the primary factor limiting large-scale use of wearable technologies for sleep and circadian research. As such, the workshop committee proposed a set of best practices for validation studies and guidelines regarding how to choose a wearable device for research and clinical use. To complement validation studies, the workshop committee recommends the development of a public data repository for wearable data. Finally, sleep and circadian scientists must actively engage in the development and use of wearable devices to maintain the rigor of scientific findings and public health messages based on wearable technology.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and metabolic syndrome are becoming more prevalent worldwide and will present an increasingly challenging burden on healthcare systems. These interlinked metabolic abnormalities predispose affected individuals to a plethora of complications and comorbidities. Furthermore, diabetes is estimated by the World Health Organization to have caused 1.5 million deaths in 2019, with this figure projected to rise in coming years. This highlights the need for further research into the management of metabolic diseases and their complications. Studies on circadian rhythms, referring to physiological and behavioral changes which repeat approximately every 24 hours, may provide important insight into managing metabolic disease. Epidemiological studies show that populations who are at risk of circadian disruption such as night shift workers and regular long-haul flyers are also at an elevated risk of metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance and obesity. Aberrant expression of circadian genes appears to contribute to the dysregulation of metabolic functions such as insulin secretion, glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure. The potential clinical implications of these findings have been highlighted in animal studies and pilot studies in humans giving rise to the development of circadian interventions strategies including chronotherapy (time-specific therapy), time-restricted feeding, and circadian molecule stabilizers/analogues. Research into these areas will provide insights into the future of circadian medicine in metabolic diseases. In this review, we discuss the physiology of metabolism and the role of circadian timing in regulating these metabolic functions. Also, we review the clinical aspects of circadian physiology and the impact that ongoing and future research may have on the management of metabolic disease.},

	abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition distinguished by structural and functional changes to the kidney over time. Studies show that 10\% of adults worldwide are affected by some kind of CKD, resulting in 1.2 million deaths. Recently, CKD has emerged as a leading cause of mortality worldwide, making it necessary to develop a Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system to diagnose CKD automatically. Machine Learning (ML) based CAD system can be used by a clinician to automatically diagnoses mass people. Since ML models are considered a black box, it is also necessary to expose influential causes behind a model's prediction of a particular output. So that, a doctor can make a more rational decision based on the model's output and analysis of the features influence on the model. In this paper, we have used the XGBoost as the ML classifier to predict whether a patient has CKD or not. Using the XGBoost classifier, we have obtained an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of \$\$99.16\{{\textbackslash}\%\}, 100\{{\textbackslash}\%\}, 98.68\{{\textbackslash}\%\},\$\$and \$\$99.33\{{\textbackslash}\%\},\$\$respectively using all \$\$24\$\$features. Furthermore, we have used Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm to find an effective subset of the features. The BBO algorithm selected almost half of the initial features.

Finally, we have explained the impact of the feature on the ML models using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Using SHAP analysis and BBO algorithm, we have found that hemoglobin and albumin mostly contribute to the detection of CKD.},

	abstract = {Background
This study sought to evaluate the performance of machine learning (ML) models and establish an explainable ML model with good prediction of 3-year all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure (HF) caused by coronary heart disease (CHD).
Methods
We established six ML models using follow-up data to predict 3-year all-cause mortality. Through comprehensive evaluation, the best performing model was used to predict and stratify patients. The log-rank test was used to assess the difference between Kaplan‚ÄìMeier curves. The association between ML risk and 3-year all-cause mortality was also assessed using multivariable Cox regression. Finally, an explainable approach based on ML and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was deployed to calculate 3-year all-cause mortality risk and to generate individual explanations of the model's decisions.
Results
The best performing extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model was selected to predict and stratify patients. Subjects with a higher ML score had a high hazard of suffering events (hazard ratio [HR]: 10.351; P¬†{\textless}¬†0.001), and this relationship persisted with a multivariable analysis (adjusted HR: 5.343; P¬†{\textless}¬†0.001). Age, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, occupation, New York Heart Association classification, and nitrate drug use were important factors for both genders.
Conclusions
The ML-based risk stratification tool was able to accurately assess and stratify the risk of 3-year all-cause mortality in patients with HF caused by CHD. ML combined with SHAP could provide an explicit explanation of individualized risk prediction and give physicians an intuitive understanding of the influence of key features in the model.},

	abstract = {Background
Machine learning (ML) holds the promise of becoming an essential tool for utilising the increasing amount of clinical data available for analysis and clinical decision support. However, the lack of trust in the models has limited the acceptance of this technology in healthcare. This mistrust is often credited to the shortage of model explainability and interpretability, where the relationship between the input and output of the models is unclear. Improving trust requires the development of more transparent ML methods.

Methods
In this paper, we use the publicly available eICU database to construct a number of ML models before examining their internal behaviour with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. Our four models predicted hospital mortality in ICU patients using a selection of the same features used to calculate the APACHE IV score and were based on random forest, logistic regression, naive Bayes, and adaptive boosting algorithms.

Results
The results showed the models had similar discriminative abilities and mostly agreed on feature importance while calibration and impact of individual features differed considerably and did in multiple cases not correspond to common medical theory.

Conclusions
We already know that ML models treat data differently depending on the underlying algorithm. Our comparative analysis visualises implications of these differences and their importance in a healthcare setting. SHAP value analysis is a promising method for incorporating explainability in model development and usage and might yield better and more trustworthy ML models in the future.},

Physical activity classification based on pre-established metrics misclassifies 20-40\% of the time, and thus, underscores the need for a more precise and accurate classification method. To this end, we investigated different machine learning algorithms to improve the clustering of 24-hour wearable-based physical activity profiles of the U.S. population in 2011-2014 NHANES. Hierarchical clustering identified 46\% of U.S. adults with "High Activity/Robust Pattern" (Cluster 1) and 54\% with "Low Activity/Weak Pattern" (Cluster 2). Cluster 1 shows elevated amplitude, high stability, and a good circadian rhythm alignment. In contrast, Cluster 2 exhibits dampened amplitude, fragmented rhythm, and substantially high nocturnal activity. Cluster 2 was also associated with older age, males, and longer sedentary hours (all p{\textless}0.05). The data-driven clustering can improve population segmentation and digital phenotyping of the general population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has demonstrated improvements in survival and neurological symptoms in patients with breast cancer with brain metastases (BCBM). This real-world study investigated the effectiveness of T-DM1 versus lapatinib plus capecitabine (LC) in patients with BCBM.
METHODS: This retrospective, observational study evaluated patients with HER2-positive BCBM using a real-world database. Eligible patients had initiated T-DM1 or LC with a prior diagnosis of brain metastasis and ‚â•1 prior metastatic breast cancer treatment. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints were time to next relevant treatment or death (TTNT) and real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS). An inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) approach was used to account for differences in potential baseline characteristics between treatment groups. Outcomes were described using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the average treatment effect of initiating T-DM1 versus LC was estimated using weighted Cox proportional hazard models and hazard ratio (HR).
RESULTS: A total of 214 patients were available for analysis (T-DM1, n¬†=¬†161; LC, n¬†=¬†53). Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally well-balanced between treatment groups after weighting. After weighting, median OS was 17.7 (T-DM1) versus 9.6 (LC) months (HR, 0.55 [95\% CI, 0.34-0.89]; P=0.013). Median TTNT was 9.0 (T-DM1) versus 6.0 (LC) months (HR, 0.55 [95\% CI, 0.36-0.85]; P¬†=¬†0.005). After weighting, median rwPFS was 6.0 (T-DM1) versus 4.0 (LC) months (HR, 0.50 [95\% CI, 0.36-0.69]; P¬†{\textless}¬†0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the superior effectiveness and clinical relevance of T-DM1 versus LC in patients with HER2-positive BCBM in the real world.},

	abstract = {Repeated disruptions in circadian rhythms are associated with implications for health outcomes and longevity. The utilization of wearable devices in quantifying circadian rhythm to elucidate its connection to longevity, through continuously collected data remains largely unstudied. In this work, we investigate a data-driven segmentation of the 24-h accelerometer activity profiles from wearables as a novel digital biomarker for longevity in 7,297 U.S. adults from the 2011‚Äì2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Using hierarchical clustering, we identified five clusters and described them as follows: ‚ÄúHigh activity‚Äù, ‚ÄúLow activity‚Äù, ‚ÄúMild circadian rhythm (CR) disruption‚Äù, ‚ÄúSevere CR disruption‚Äù, and ‚ÄúVery low activity‚Äù. Young adults with extreme CR disturbance are seemingly healthy with few comorbid conditions, but in fact associated with higher white blood cell, neutrophils, and lymphocyte counts (0.05‚Äì0.07 log-unit, all p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.05) and accelerated biological aging (1.42¬†years, p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001). Older adults with CR disruption are significantly associated with increased systemic inflammation indexes (0.09‚Äì0.12 log-unit, all p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.05), biological aging advance (1.28¬†years, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.021), and all-cause mortality risk (HR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.58, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.042). Our findings highlight the importance of circadian alignment on longevity across all ages and suggest that data from wearable accelerometers can help in identifying at-risk populations and personalize treatments for healthier aging.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: On the basis of the results from CLEOPATRA, pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy is the first-line standard of care for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, discrepancies have been reported between clinical trial and real-world outcomes. We report real-world outcomes for patients with HER2-positive MBC treated with first-line pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and a taxane in routine clinical practice in the United States.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using electronic health record-derived deidentified data from the Flatiron Health database. Patients were grouped according to the first taxane received (paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel or docetaxel). Median real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and overall survival (rwOS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Subgroup analyses were conducted in patients treated with docetaxel who met CLEOPATRA's key eligibility criteria.
RESULTS: We included 1,065 patients; 313 patients received paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel and 752 received docetaxel. Patients who received paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel were older, had a worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, and had more recurrent metastatic disease compared with the docetaxel group. After adjustment for potential confounders, similar median rwPFS (inverse probability of treatment weighted average treatment effect for the treated [IPTW-ATT] hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.9 to 1.3; P = .365) and rwOS (IPTW-ATT HR, 1.23; 95\% CI, 0.96 to 1.58; P = .101) was observed between treatment groups. In the subgroup of CLEOPATRA-eligible patients, median rwPFS and rwOS were 16.9 months and 57.8 months, respectively.
CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference in real-world outcomes between patients treated with paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel and those treated with docetaxel. Selecting patients using key CLEOPATRA eligibility criteria resulted in rwPFS and rwOS similar to those observed in CLEOPATRA, highlighting the importance of ensuring similar patient populations when comparing clinical trial and real-world data.},

Background: Dual HER2 blockade with pertuzumab (P) + trastuzumab (H), combined with taxane induction therapy, is the standard of care for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-positive MBC. In clinical practice, after achieving clinical benefit with approximately 4‚Äì6 cycles of PH + taxane induction, maintenance therapy is continued with PH only until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity. Approximately 50‚Äì60\% of patients with HER2-positive MBC also have concurrent HR expression and may receive ET in combination with PH. This study investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients initiating ET combined with PH as maintenance therapy after completion of PH + taxane induction. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a nationwide US electronic health record-derived de-identified database (Flatiron Health). Patients with HER2-positive and HR-positive MBC who initiated an ET between Jan 1, 2012 and Feb 28, 2021 with concomitant PH after receiving at least four cycles of first-line PH + taxane induction were included. The index date was the date of ET initiation. Progression data were abstracted from the medical charts. Mortality data were abstracted and combined with patient-level structured data (obituaries and Social Security Death Index). rwPFS was defined as the time from index date until first progression event {\textgreater} 14 days after the index date, or date of death; otherwise, patients were censored on the date of last clinical note abstraction. Baseline characteristics were described using summary statistics, and rwPFS in the maintenance setting was described using a Kaplan‚ÄìMeier estimator from the index date. Results: Of 24,690 patients diagnosed with MBC in the database, 252 (1\%) met the eligibility criteria. All patients were female. The median age was 56.6 years; 149 patients (59\%) were diagnosed with de novo MBC; 248 (98\%), with estrogen receptor-positive disease; and 182 (72\%), with progesterone receptor-positive disease. One hundred ninety-three patients (77\%) received an aromatase inhibitor as ET. The median number of taxane cycles received prior to the index date was six. Median maintenance rwPFS was 21.4 months (95\% confidence interval = 16.1, 25.3). Conclusions: Given the therapeutic opportunity presented by HER2/HR co-expression and the favorable maintenance rwPFS shown here with PH + ET following taxane induction, the investigation of more potent ETs combined with PH is justified in order to further improve outcomes in first-line HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC.},

Background: Real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and time to next line of therapy (TTNT) are two endpoints of clinical interest in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Their validation as intermediate endpoints for overall survival (OS), in a real-world setting, remains not fully established. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the nationwide US Electronic Health Record-derived de-identified Flatiron Health database. The study population included pts diagnosed with MBC from Jan 1, 2011 to Feb 30, 2021. rwPFS was defined as the time from start of first-line systemic therapy for MBC to disease progression or death. TTNT was defined as the time from start of first-line systemic therapy until start of next line of therapy. The nonparametric Kendall tau correlation between each surrogate endpoint (rwPFS and TTNT) and OS was evaluated using the Hougaard copula model in the Weibull margin distribution. Kendall‚Äôs tau (œÑ) with its 95\%CI was calculated across the entire dataset, and within each disease subgroup defined by receptor (ER and/or PR status defined as hormone receptor [HR], and HER2) status. This work was conducted on behalf of the imCORE network and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Results: Overall, 9,770 patients with MBC were included. Median age was 63 years (IQR: 54-72 years). HR+/HER2- disease represented the most frequent MBC subtype (n=6,287; 64.4\%), followed by HER2+ (n=2,096; 21.5\%) and triple negative (n=1,387; 14.2\%) disease. Median f/u was 41.5 months (95\%CI: 40.4 to 42.8). Median OS in the overall population was 32.4 months (95\%CI: 31.2 to 33.3). Median rwPFS was 11.5 months (95\%CI: 11.1 to 11.9), and median TTNT was 11.1 months (95\%CI: 10.7 to 11.5). Across the entire population, the correlation of rwPFS with OS was 0.54 (95\%CI: 0.53-0.56), while the correlation of TTNT with OS was 0.47 (95\%CI: 0.46-0.48) (Table). Conclusions: rwPFS and TTNT may represent meaningful intermediate endpoints for OS in patients with MBC overall, and within the different disease subgroups.

Methods Patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated between Jan 1, 2013 and May 31, 2018 were included from the de-identified US-based Flatiron Health electronic health record-derived database. Patients initiating T-DM1 and with a recent LVEF value of 40-49\% up to 60 days prior to treatment were included. Patient baseline characteristics (including cardiac history) were described, and the risk of an LVEF drop of \&gt;10\% points, CHF, and other cardiac events during treatment, and the 84 days following treatment discontinuation, were examined. Results Of approximately 2000 patients with metastatic breast cancer initiating T-DM1 in the database, 32 (1.6\%) had an LVEF measurement of 40-49\% at baseline (as defined above). These patients had a median age of 64.5 years, median body mass index of 26.1 kg/m2, and 65.6\% were white. Median T-DM1 treatment duration was 4.6 months. Cardiac history included prior breast cancer treatment discontinuation due to cardiotoxicity (62.5\%), CHF signs and symptoms (34.4\%), CHF (28.1\%), and prior cardiac hospitalization (18.8\%). LVEF monitoring was conducted during treatment for 81.0\% of patients who had \&gt;2 months of T-DM1 treatment. An LVEF drop of \&gt;10\% points occurred in four patients (12.5\%); CHF events, in five patients (15.6\%). Incidence rates were 34.4 and 8.5 per 100 person-years, respectively. These nine events occurred in seven patients, six of whom had relevant cardiac history events recorded in their electronic health record at baseline. CHF signs and symptoms were reported in nine patients (28.1\%; 50.5 per 100 person-years) and cardiac tachyarrhythmia in one patient (3.1\%; 5.1 per 100 person-years). In a sensitivity analysis that comprised 35 additional patients (N=67) with an LVEF of 40-50\% (including overlapping LVEF ranges), the following additional events were recorded: CHF (1); cardiac tachyarrhythmia (1), and CHF signs and symptoms (6). Conclusion A small proportion of patients initiate T-DM1 with low LVEF. The risk of cardiac events observed appears to be consistent with the population profile presenting a cardiac history. The decision for physicians to prescribe T-DM1 in patients with low LVEF should be made in the context of the benefit-risk consideration for cardiac events and the availability of alternative treatment.Citation Format: Thibaut Sanglier, Jinjoo Shim, Harry Liu, Chunyan Song, Melanie Smitt, Evelyn M Flahavan.

	abstract = {Background: Clinical practice guidelines recommend the combination of pertuzumab (PERJETA¬Æ), trastuzumab (Herceptin¬Æ) (PH) and a taxane for first-line treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer (HER2+ mBC) patients [Giordano et al., J Oncol Pract, 2018]. Most clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab and trastuzumab used docetaxel as the taxane (PHD) [Tian et al., Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther, 2017]. Paclitaxel used with pertuzumab and trastuzumab (PHP) is highly active and well tolerated and may be an effective alternative to docetaxel-based combination therapy (Bachelot et al., Ann Oncol, 2019; Dang et al., J Clin Oncol, 2017). We evaluated the use of taxanes with PH and patient outcomes after receiving PHP or PHD as first-line treatment for HER2+ mBC in a real-world setting. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, using the nationwide Flatiron Health Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived de-identified database. Patients who received a taxane with PH as initial systemic therapy after mBC diagnosis between June 1, 2012 and April 30, 2019 were included. The taxane initiation and any switch was evaluated. An intention-to-treat analysis was adopted and we used Cox-proportional hazard model in the statistical analysis. Time To Last Administration (TTLA) was used as a proxy for treatment duration for PH and chemotherapy. Real world progression free survival (rwPFS) was used to describe the effectiveness of first-line therapies. Results: A total of 1054 patients received PH plus a taxane as first-line therapy for HER2+ mBC: 29.3\% of patients received PHP (26.9\% paclitaxel and 2.4\% nab-paclitaxel) while 70.7\% of patients received PHD. Patients in the PHP group at index date were significantly older (median age was 62.0 in PHP vs 58.0 in PHD group, \&lt;0.001), more likely to be recurrent patients (51.8\% in PHP vs 44.3\% in PHD, 0.032) and less frequently treated in the community setting (86.7\% in PHP vs 96.4\% in PHD, \&lt;0.001). Fifty-four (5.1\%) patients switched taxane during first-line therapy. Fifteen (5.3\%) switched from paclitaxel to nab-paclitaxel, 39 (5.2\%) switched from docetaxel to either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel. No patient switched from paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel to docetaxel. Median TTLA of the index taxane was 3.7 months (3.42, 3.91) in PHP vs 3.5 months (3.45, 3.45) in PHD. Median TTLA of PH was 10.6 months (95\% CI 8.51-11.8) for PHP and 11.8 months (95\% CI 10.49-13.3) for PHD. Median rwPFS was 12.9 months (95\% CI 11.2, 15.8) for PHP and 14.9 months (95\% CI 13.2-16.9) for PHD. No statistically significant difference was found between PHP and PHD for TTLA of PH and for rwPFS either in the unadjusted models or in the models adjusted for potential confounders. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing the real world use of paclitaxel and evaluating the effectiveness of PHP vs PHD as first-line treatment in HER2+ mBC patients. PHP is used in the community practice and appears as effective as PHD.Citation Format: Letizia Polito, Jinjoo Shim, Yolande Du Toit, Thy Do, Adam Knott, Thibaut Sanglier.

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have expanded treatment options for patients with solid tumors. Systemic corticosteroids (CSs) have an indispensable role in cancer care, but CS-related immunosuppression may counteract the CPI-driven antitumor immune response. This retrospective study investigated the association between baseline CS use (bCS; ‚â§14¬†days before, ‚â§30¬†days after CPI initiation) and clinical outcomes in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC), melanoma (aMel), or urothelial carcinoma (aUC). We analyzed data from the Flatiron Health electronic health record‚Äìderived de-identified database for adults diagnosed with aNSCLC, aMel, or aUC between January 2011 and June 2017 who received ‚â•1 CPI monotherapy in any treatment line. Associations of bCS use with overall survival (OS) and time to next treatment (TTNT) were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics (i.e., ECOG performance status, site of metastases). In total, 2,213 patients were diagnosed with aNSCLC (n¬†=¬†862), aMel (n¬†=¬†742), or aUC (n¬†=¬†609) and received ‚â•1 CPI administration. Most patients (67\%-95\%) received CSs, many during the baseline period (19\%-30\%). Patients with bCS use had shorter median OS than those with no bCS use for aNSCLC (6.6 vs 10.6¬†months; P=¬†.00018), aMel (16.4 vs 21.5; P=¬†.095), and aUC (4.1 vs 7.7; P=¬†.0012). bCS use was associated with shorter OS (not significant for aMel) and TTNT in adjusted multivariable analyses, and clinical outcomes were not explained by prior CS use or other measured confounders. These findings suggest a potential association between bCS use and decreased CPI effectiveness, warranting further investigation.},

	abstract = {Background: Corticosteroids (CS) are often prescribed with cancer treatment to alleviate symptoms, treat comorbidities and manage treatment-related adverse events. The immunosuppressive properties of CS may decrease the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy (CIT), and the effect may vary by tumor site. This study explored the association of baseline CS (bCS) use with time to next treatment (TTNT) in CIT-treated patients with advanced melanoma (aMel), advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) or advanced urothelial cancer (aUC).Methods: The Flatiron Health electronic health record-derived de-identified database was used to select patients diagnosed with aMel, aNSCLC or aUC between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2017, who received CIT alone in any treatment line and were followed through March 30, 2018. bCS included intramuscular or intravenous administrations or oral orders ‚â§ 14 days before and ‚â§ 30 days after the CIT start date. TTNT is a measure of intermediate outcomes, such as cancer progression, in real-world data sources. A TTNT event was defined as initiation of a new line of non-maintenance treatment or death within 60 days of the last CIT treatment during the index line of therapy. Other patients were censored at the latter of either their last CIT administration or last recorded visit. The association of bCS with TTNT was estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for key baseline characteristics, including prior CS use.Results: Most patients were white men aged 66 to 72 years; median follow-up across tumor types was 3.9 to 5.5 months. One-fifth to one-third (19\%-30\%) of patients received bCS. More than half of patients (58\%-61\%) received a new treatment line during the study period, the milestone for measuring TTNT. Patients receiving bCS were more likely to have stage IV disease at diagnosis, brain or liver metastases (aNSCLC, aUC) and poorer ECOG performance status (aUC) at baseline. After adjusting for these and other important potential confounders, including prior CS use, bCS use was associated with shorter TTNT compared with no bCS use in multivariable models (aMel HR, 1.28 [95\% CI: 1.03, 1.58]; aNSCLC HR, 1.40 [1.16, 1.70]; aUC HR, 1.36 [1.06, 1.82]).Conclusions: After adjustments for measured confounders, patients receiving bCS had a shorter TTNT than those who did not receive bCS, suggesting a shorter treatment duration that may limit the potential long-term benefits of CIT use. TTNT is commonly used as a proxy for disease progression in real-world data sources; however, treatment changes could be due to reasons other than progression. Further studies are needed to confirm these observations.Keywords/Indexing: Lung cancer: non-small cell; Melanoma/skin cancers[A.D. and P.K.D. contributed equally to this work.]Citation Format: Alexandra Drakaki, Preet K.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the value to society of improved survival from novel immuno-oncology (I-O) treatments.
STUDY DESIGN: Case studies of ipilimumab for the treatment of advanced unresectable melanoma and nivolumab for advanced previously treated squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Published data and survival analysis were used to estimate survival gains. We valued the gains using an economic model developed for application to discrete changes in life expectancy. We estimated aggregate utilization and value to society using cancer registry data and literature. We assessed the share of social value that flowed to the pharmaceutical manufacturer as sales revenue based on publicly available prices.
RESULTS: For advanced melanoma, our analysis estimated an average real-world life expectancy (discounted at a 3\% rate) of 32.4 months with ipilimumab versus 14.2 months with an existing standard of care. Treatment of advanced NSCLC with nivolumab generated a life expectancy of 28.1 months versus 14.3 months with an existing standard of care. Depending on model assumptions, the value of these survival gains ranged from \$232,000 to \$697,000 for a patient with melanoma and from \$180,000 to \$586,000 for one with NSCLC. Using a midpoint value to aggregate across treated patients over a 5-year window, the total value to society was estimated at \$1.9 billion for ipilimumab in advanced melanoma and \$1.7 billion for nivolumab in NSCLC. Less than 30\% of the total value flowed to the pharmaceutical manufacturer in the form of profit.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel I-O treatments studied here generate substantial survival gains and, thus, social value. Less than half of this value accrued to the pharmaceutical manufacturer as sales revenue.},

Background: Although new oncology treatments have the potential to improve patient health, these innovations take time to reach to real-world patients. In this study, we estimated how delays in the uptake of novel oncology treatments affect real-world patient survival. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used 1991-2013 data from a cancer-registry linked to health care claims (SEER-Medicare). Our endpoint of interest was patient overall survival. We used variability in the adoption of new cancer treatments across aggregated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) (n = 50) as a ‚Äúnatural experiment‚Äù that assigned treatments randomly across patients, depending entirely on where they live. This approach recovers the effect of the new treatment on the overall survival of the ‚Äúmarginal patient,‚Äù who received treatment solely because she resides in an area with faster uptake. This framework was applied to six case studies: trastuzumab (breast), bevacizumab (colorectal), bevacizumab (lung), erlotinib (lung), bortezomib (myeloma) and lenalidomide (myeloma). Results: Among the 92,496 patients in the study, the difference between adoption rates among eligible patients for MSAs at the 90th percentile and those at the 10th percentile was 20.1 percentage points, with the largest differences being for bevacizumab (colorectal) (51.2\% at the 90th percentile MSA vs. 20.9\% at the 10th percentile), and smallest for erlotinib (10.3\% vs. 2.8\%). Median OS among eligible patients gaining access to these landmark therapies increased by 9.6 months. Survival improvements were largest for the lenalidomide case study (33.4 months OS improvement, p {\textless} 0.005) followed by erlotinib (21.2 mo., p {\textless} 0.001), trastuzumab (19.2 mo., p = 0.016), bevacizumab for lung (7.4 mo., p = 0.002), bevacizumab for colorectal cancer (4.0 mo., p = 0.062), and bortezomib (2.9 mo., p = 0.630). Conclusions: Improving the speed at which landmark treatments are adopted in practice‚Äîthrough physician education and outreach or more generous health insurance access policies‚Äîhas the potential to improve real-world survival for cancer patients.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To illustrate a more comprehensive view of value associated with medicines treating a highly severe illness and to apply these insights to estimate the costs and benefits of 3 treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS): Avonex, Tysabri, and Tecfidera.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study spanning 2002 to 2013. We used economic theory to derive the value of therapy to patients with MS and to individuals who face the risk of contracting MS in the future, under the alternative assumptions that therapies were fully insured or paid for out of pocket.
METHODS: Models were parameterized through secondary data analysis and targeted literature review. Estimates of individual value were aggregated to the societal level using therapy-specific treatment prevalence rates. Aggregate consumer value was compared with manufacturer revenue.
RESULTS: In the baseline model, Avonex, Tysabri, and Tecfidera generated \$46.2 billion of total value to consumers, almost one-third of which accrued to those without MS. The total value to consumers was double manufacturer revenue. Results were qualitatively robust to the use of alternate epidemiological and economic parameters. We found that value to the healthy is positively related to disease severity, and that value to both the sick and the healthy are larger when costs are shared via health insurance.
CONCLUSIONS: Theory predicts that treatments for severe disease provide "peace of mind" value to the healthy. Avonex, Tysabri, and Tecfidera have generated significant social value, a large majority of which accrues to consumers. Future economic valuations of medical technology should consider both the potential value to the healthy and the effects of insurance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is considerable push to improve value in health care by simultaneously increasing quality while lowering or containing costs. However, for diseases that are best treated with comparatively expensive treatments, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there could be tension between these aims. In this study, we measured geographic variation in quality, access, and cost for patients with RA, a disease with effective but costly specialty treatments.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the geographic differences in the quality, access, and cost of care for patients with RA.
METHODS: Using large claims databases covering the period between 2008 and 2014, we measured quality of care metrics by metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) for patients with RA. Quality measures included use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and tuberculosis (TB) screening before initiating biologic DMARD therapy. Access to care measures included measured detection and the share of patients with RA who visited a rheumatologist. Regression models were used to control for differences in patient demographics and health status across MSAs.
RESULTS: For the 501,376 patients diagnosed with RA, in the average MSA 64.1\% of RA patients received a DMARD, and 29.6\% of RA patients initiating a biologic DMARD appropriately received a TB screening. Only 17\% (73/430) of MSAs comprised the top 2 Medicare Advantage star ratings for DMARD use. Measured detection was 0.59\% (IQR = 0.47\%-0.71\%; CV = 0.355) on average, and 57.6\% (IQR = 48\%-69\%; CV = 0.341) of RA patients visited a rheumatologist. MSAs with the highest DMARD use spent \$26,724 (in 2015 U.S. dollars) annually treating patients with RA, \$5,428 more (P {\textless} 0.001) than low DMARD-use MSAs, largely because of higher pharmacy cost (\$5,090 vs. \$7,610, P {\textless} 0.001). However, MSAs with higher DMARD use had lower RA-related inpatient cost (\$1,890 vs. \$2,342, P = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: There were significant geographic variations in the quality of care received by patients with RA, although quality was poor in most areas. Fewer than 1 in 5 MSAs could be considered high quality based on patient DMARD use. Access to specialist care may be an issue, since just over half of patients with RA visited a rheumatologist annually. Efforts to incentivize better quality of care holds promise in terms of unlocking value for patients, but for some diseases, this approach may result in higher costs.

	abstract = {BACKGROUNDAdjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer decreases recurrence and increases survival. However, early discontinuation of chemotherapy occurs frequently and has a negative influence on patient outcomes.METHODSThe Breast Cancer Quality of Care Study (BQUAL) is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate factors associated with early discontinuation of adjuvant chemotherapy among women diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer at three sites in the U.S between 2006 and 2010 (Columbia University Medical Center, Kaiser-Permanente of Northern California, Henry Ford Health System). Chemotherapy regimens were classified based on NCCN guidelines. Regimens were further categorized as standard and non-standard/experimental. Early discontinuation for standard treatments was defined as missing 20\% of the recommended number of treatments for the prescribed regimen. We used multivariate analysis to examine the association between early discontinuation and sociodemographic factors, tumor characteristics, and baseline psychosocial factors.RESULTSOf 1157 women recruited, 478 patients initiated chemotherapy; 35 women received non-standard/experimental chemotherapy and an additional 17 did not complete all interviews and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 426 patients, 59 (13.9\%) did not complete the full course of prescribed chemotherapy. In multivariate analysis, compared to those who completed their full prescribed course of adjuvant chemotherapy, those who discontinued were more often \&gt;50 years of age (p=0.04). Early discontinuation of chemotherapy was less likely among Asian women (OR 0.12, 95\% CI 0.01-0.96), those who held positive beliefs related to the efficacy of chemotherapy (OR 0.43, 95\% CI 0.22-0.81), and those who were more optimistic (OR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.86-0.99). Women prescribed chemotherapy regimens that had more cycles (\&gt;5 cycles) or contained paclitaxel/docetaxel were significantly more likely (OR 7.54, 95\% CI 2.68-21.20 and OR 5.02, 95\% CI 1.59-15.83, respectively) to discontinue chemotherapy treatment early than regimens with 6 or less cycles.CONCLUSIONSWomen prescribed longer regimens were significantly more likely not to complete the full course. Positive beliefs about the efficacy of treatment were associated with continuation of treatment. Educational interventions focused on the importance of completing therapy may increase chemotherapy adherence.Citation Format: Alfred I Neugut, Grace C Hillyer, Lawrence W Kushi, Lois Lamerato, Jinjoo Shim, Dana H Bovberg, David Nathanson, Christine B Ambrisone, Jeanne S Mandelblatt, Carol Magai, Wei Yann Tsai, Judith S Jacobson, Dawn L Hershman.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recent randomized trial demonstrated that for metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC), a complication of advanced prostate cancer, surgical decompression may be more effective than external beam radiation therapy (RT). We investigated predictors of MESCC, its treatment, and its impact on hospital length of stay for patients with advanced prostate cancer.
METHODS: We used the SEER-Medicare database to identify patients {\textgreater}65 years with stage IV (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ14,800) prostate cancer. We used polytomous logistic regression to compare those with and without MESCC and those hospitalized for treatment with surgical decompression and/or RT.
RESULTS: MESCC developed in 711 (5 \%) of patients, among whom 359 (50 \%) received RT and 107 (15 \%) underwent surgery‚Äâ¬±‚ÄâRT. Median survival was 10 months. MESCC was more likely among patients who were black (OR 1.75, 95 \%CI 1.39-2.19 vs. white) and had high-grade tumors (OR 3.01, 95 \%CI 1.14-7.94), and less likely in those younger; with prior hormonal therapy (OR 0.73, 95 \%CI 0.62-0.86); or with osteoporosis (OR 0.63, 95 \%CI 0.47-0.83). Older patients were less likely to undergo either RT or surgery, as were those with ‚â•1 comorbidity. Patients with high-grade tumors were more likely to undergo RT (OR 1.92, 95 \%CI 1.25-2.96). Those who underwent RT or surgery spent an additional 11 and 29 days, respectively, hospitalized.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that black men with metastatic prostate cancer are more likely to develop MESCC than whites. RT was more commonly utilized for treatment than surgery, but the elderly and those with comorbidities were unlikely to receive either treatment.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Since 2004, concerns about the safety of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have resulted in label changes and restrictions on their use. We examined changes in ESA use and blood transfusions over time.
METHODS: The SEER-Medicare database was used to identify patients age ‚â• 65 years with breast, lung, prostate, ovary, or colon cancer, diagnosed between 2000 and 2007, who had a chemotherapy claim after their cancer diagnosis. We calculated the mean number of ESA claims per patient per year. Follow-up claims were available through 2008. We used multivariable logistic regression models to analyze the association of ESA use and extended ESA use with clinical and demographic variables.
RESULTS: Among 121,169 patients identified, 46,063 (38\%) received an ESA. ESA use increased from 12.4\% to 16.2\% by 2006 and then decreased to 7.9\% by 2008. Similarly, the mean number of ESA claims per patient decreased steadily over the entire timeframe. The annual percentage of patients undergoing transfusion remained relatively constant (9\% to 10\%). In a Cox proportional hazards time-dependent model, ESA use was positively associated with black race (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.07 to 1.15), metropolitan location (OR, 1.17; 95\% CI, 1.13 to 1.21), metastatic disease (OR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.35 to 1.41), female sex (OR, 1.17; 95\% CI, 1.14 to 1.20), {\textgreater} one comorbidity (OR, 1.29; 95\% CI, 1.25 to 1.32), and tumor type. The number of denied claims increased over time.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated a rapid decline in the percentage of patients treated with ESAs after changes to reimbursement policy, but not after warnings about use. Reimbursement restrictions of other overused or off-label drugs may help reduce health care expenditures.},

Background: Image-guided percutaneous pleural needle biopsy (IGPPB) is an important tool in the diagnosis and management of cancer patients. Complications of IGPPB include pneumothorax and chest tube placement. Small, single institution studies report rates of pneumothorax between 8-60\% and subsequent chest tube in 6-53\%. We performed a population-based analysis to evaluate patterns of use, complication rates, and cost associated with IGPPB. Methods: The Premier Perspective database was used to identify cancer patients with at least 1 claim for IGPPB from 2006-2012. Perspective is a fee-supported database created to measure resource utilization and quality from {\textgreater}600 US hospitals. Patients with a pneumothorax were defined by claims within 1 month of IGPPB; rates of hospitalization, chest tube placement and hospital length of stay (LOS) after pneumothorax were analyzed. Multivariable analysis was performed to further examine patient, insurance and hospital characteristics associated with biopsy setting (outpatient vs. inpatient). Pleural biopsy volume and procedure-associated costs over time were evaluated. Results: We identified 59,796 cancer patients who received ‚â•1 IGPPB, 32,474 (54.3\%) in outpatients and 27,322 (45.7\%) in inpatients. Characteristics associated with outpatient IGPPB included: younger age, white race, less comorbidity, tumor type, commercial insurance and larger hospitals (p{\textless}0.01). Of patients who received outpatient IGPPB, 3,835 (11.8\%) developed a pneumothorax, 749 (19.5\%, 2.3\% of total) were hospitalized and 140 (3.7\%, 0.4\% of total) required chest tube. Among patients who received IGPPB as an inpatient, 5,638 (20.6\%) developed a pneumothorax and, of those, 2,321 (41.2\%, 20.4\% total) required chest tube. LOS was similar for patients hospitalized after outpatient IGPPB (median 6, mean 7.9) compared to inpatient IGPPB (median 6, mean 8.7). Over time, IGPPB volume increased by 33\%, patient costs rose by 53\% and outpatient costs rose by 16\%. Conclusions: We have shown that in a large population-based sample the use of IGPPB has increased substantially. While pneumothorax was frequent in outpatients, the rate of hospitalization and chest tube placement was small.},

This study examines the efficiency of a sequence of light flashes (‚Äúflash therapy‚Äù) applied during sleep to shift the clock. Healthy participants (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ10) took part in two 36-h laboratory stays, receiving a placebo (goggles, no light) during one visit and the intervention (goggles, 2-ms flashes broad-spectrum light for 60¬†min, delivered every 15¬†s, starting 30¬†min after habitual sleep onset) during the other. Circadian phase shift was assessed with changes in salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). Sleep, measured with polysomnography, was analyzed to assess changes in sleep architecture and spectral power. After 1¬†h of flashes, DLMO showed a substantial delay (1.13‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.27¬†h) compared to placebo (12‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ20¬†min). Two individuals exhibited very large shifts of 6.4 and 3.1¬†h. There were no substantive differences in sleep architecture, but some evidence for greater instability in sleep. 1¬†h of flash therapy during sleep evokes large changes in circadian timing, up to 6¬†h, and does so with only minimal, if any, impact on sleep.

	abstract = {IntroductionA consolidated sleep-wake pattern is essential for maintaining healthy cognition in older individuals, but many suffer from sleep fragmentation that exacerbates age-related cognitive decline and worsens overall mental and physical health. Timed light exposure (light therapy) has been explored as a countermeasure, but mixed results have been obtained. To determine whether the timing of light exposure is important for sleep-wake consolidation, we analyzed the natural light diets of a cohort of community-dwelling older men.MethodsThe degree of sleep-wake fragmentation and light exposure patterns were obtained over a week using wrist actigraphy. Correlations between fragmentation, light patterns, and various physical and mental health measures were examined (n = 877).ResultsOur findings revealed that higher sleep-wake fragmentation correlated with poorer physical and mental health and reduced cognition. Moreover, reduced daytime light exposure was associated with increased sleep-wake fragmentation. Interestingly, morning and evening light exposure ({\textgreater}1,000 lux) were not useful in distinguishing between low and high sleep-wake fragmentation scores, while increased afternoon light exposure showed much better discrimination. Specifically, optimal discrimination between low and high fragmentation occurred 6.7 h after habitual sleep offset. This suggests that afternoon light therapy might be more efficient in consolidating sleep and wake in older adults, particularly in those with low-amplitude circadian rhythms.DiscussionThis study highlights the significance of properly-timed light exposure in promoting consolidated sleep and cognitive health among older individuals. Tailored light-based strategies may have the potential to enhance physical, mental, and cognitive well-being in the aging population.},

	abstract = {We developed a machine learning methodology for automatic sleep stage scoring. Our time-frequency analysis-based feature extraction is fine-tuned to capture sleep stage-specific signal features as described in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine manual that the human experts follow. We used ensemble learning with an ensemble of stacked sparse autoencoders for classifying the sleep stages. We used class-balanced random sampling across sleep stages for each model in the ensemble to avoid skewed performance in favor of the most represented sleep stages, and addressed the problem of misclassification errors due to class imbalance while significantly improving worst-stage classification. We used an openly available dataset from 20 healthy young adults for evaluation. We used a single channel of EEG from this dataset, which makes our method a suitable candidate for longitudinal monitoring using wearable EEG in real-world settings. Our method has both high overall accuracy (78\%, range 75‚Äì80\%), and high mean \$\$F\_1\$\$-score (84\%, range 82‚Äì86\%) and mean accuracy across individual sleep stages (86\%, range 84‚Äì88\%) over all subjects. The performance of our method appears to be uncorrelated with the sleep efficiency and percentage of transitional epochs in each recording.},

	abstract = {Data integration, data sharing, and standardized analyses are important enablers for data-driven medical research. Circadian medicine is an emerging field with a particularly high need for coordinated and systematic collaboration between researchers from different disciplines. Datasets in circadian medicine are multimodal, ranging from molecular circadian profiles and clinical parameters to physiological measurements and data obtained from (wearable) sensors or reported by patients. Uniquely, data spanning both the time dimension and the spatial dimension (across tissues) are needed to obtain a holistic view of the circadian system. The study of human rhythms in the context of circadian medicine has to confront the heterogeneity of clock properties within and across subjects and our inability to repeatedly obtain relevant biosamples from one subject. This requires informatics solutions for integrating and visualizing relevant data types at various temporal resolutions ranging from milliseconds and seconds to minutes and several hours. Associated challenges range from a lack of standards that can be used to represent all required data in a common interoperable form, to challenges related to data storage, to the need to perform transformations for integrated visualizations, and to privacy issues. The downstream analysis of circadian rhythms requires specialized approaches for the identification, characterization, and discrimination of rhythms. We conclude that circadian medicine research provides an ideal environment for developing innovative methods to address challenges related to the collection, integration, visualization, and analysis of multimodal multidimensional biomedical data.},

Sensor data include skin temperature, skin conductance, and acceleration; wellbeing labels include self-reported mood, health and stress scored 0 - 100. Compared to the prediction performance based on hand-crafted features, the proposed framework achieved higher precision with a smaller number of features. We also provide statistical interpretation and visual explanation to the automatically learned features and the prediction models.

Biomarkers for the early assessment of chronic disorders encompass acute phase proteins (APP), cytokines and chemokines, pro-inflammatory enzymes, lipids and oxidative stress mediators. These substances enter saliva through the blood flow and, in some cases, there is a close relation between their salivary and serum concentration. Saliva can be easily collected and stored with non-invasive and cost-saving procedures, and it is emerging the concept to use it for the detection of inflammatory biomarkers. To this purpose, the present review aims to discuss the advantages and challenges of using standard and cutting-edge techniques to discover salivary biomarkers which may be used in diagnosis/therapy of several chronic diseases with inflammatory consequences with the pursuit to possibly replace conventional paths with detectable soluble mediators in saliva. Specifically, the review describes the procedures used for saliva collection, the standard approaches for the measurement of salivary biomarkers and the novel methodological strategies such as biosensors to improve the quality of care for chronically affected patients.},

	abstract = {Background
Point-of-care (POC) C-reactive protein (CRP) testing in the primary healthcare setting is a cost-effective approach for reducing antibiotic prescriptions, but has yet to be widely adopted.
Methods
Analytical performance of the cobas CRP Test on the cobas b 101 system was evaluated at three POC sites and one reference laboratory. Within-run (repeatability), within-laboratory (intermediate precision), and between-laboratory precision (reproducibility) were assessed. Method comparison (reference test: CRPNX reagent [cobas c 501 module]) and matrix/lot-to-lot comparison experiments were conducted using prospectively collected blood samples from 217 adults (apparently healthy or with clinically relevant conditions). Usability and reliability were assessed by questionnaire and error reporting.
Results
Coefficients of variation (CV) for repeatability and intermediate precision ranged from 1.7\%‚Äì4.0\% and 1.9\%‚Äì4.5\%, respectively, for human serum pools containing CRP 4.7‚Äì350.7‚ÄØmg/L; repeatability in clinical samples ranged from 1.6\%‚Äì5.9\% (3.3‚Äì360.3‚ÄØmg/L). CVs for reproducibility ranged from 2.5\%‚Äì4.0\% (4.7‚Äì344.3‚ÄØmg/L). CRP concentrations were comparable for capillary whole blood, serum, Li-heparin whole blood/plasma, K2 and K3 EDTA whole blood/plasma (Pearson's r‚ÄØ‚â•‚ÄØ0.996), and among three CRP Test lots (r‚ÄØ‚â•‚ÄØ0.993). Clinically relevant CRP concentrations measured with the CRP Test showed good agreement with those measured by CRPNX reagent (serum, weighted Deming regression y‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.97√ó‚ÄØ+‚ÄØ0.11; Pearson's r‚ÄØ‚â•‚ÄØ0.996). The overall mean usability score was 4.18/5 and the error rate across 9378 tests was 1.00\%.
Conclusions
The cobas CRP Test on the cobas b 101 system demonstrates robust analytic performance when used by healthcare professionals in the POC setting.},

	abstract = {Body temperature is an important physiological parameter in many studies of laboratory mice. Continuous assessment of body temperature has traditionally required surgical implantation of a telemeter, but this invasive procedure adversely impacts animal welfare. Near-infrared thermography provides a non-invasive alternative by continuously measuring the highest temperature on the outside of the body (Tskin), but the reliability of these recordings as a proxy for continuous core body temperature (Tcore) measurements has not been assessed. Here, Tcore (30¬†s resolution) and Tskin (1¬†s resolution) were continuously measured for three days in mice exposed to ad libitum and restricted feeding conditions. We subsequently developed an algorithm that optimised the reliability of a Tskin-derived estimate of Tcore. This identified the average of the maximum Tskin per minute over a 30-min interval as the optimal way to estimate Tcore. Subsequent validation analyses did however demonstrate that this Tskin-derived proxy did not provide a reliable estimate of the absolute Tcore due to the high between-animal variability in the relationship between Tskin and Tcore. Conversely, validation showed that Tskin-derived estimates of Tcore reliably describe temporal patterns in physiologically-relevant Tcore changes and provide an excellent measure to perform within-animal comparisons of relative changes in Tcore.},

	abstract = {The vast majority of patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder will develop a neurodegenerative Œ±-synuclein-related condition, such as Parkinson‚Äôs disease or dementia with Lewy bodies. The pathology underlying dream enactment overlaps anatomically with the brainstem regions that regulate circadian core body temperature. Previously, nocturnal core body temperature regulation has been shown to be impaired in Parkinson‚Äôs disease. However, no study to date has investigated nocturnal core body temperature changes in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, which may prove to be an early objective biomarker for Œ±-synucleinopathies. Ten healthy controls, 15 patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, 31 patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease and six patients with dementia with Lewy bodies underwent clinical assessment and nocturnal polysomnography with core body temperature monitoring. A validated cosinor method was utilised for core body temperature analysis. No differences in mesor, nadir or time of nadir were observed between groups. However, when compared with healthy controls, the amplitude of the nocturnal core body temperature (mesor minus nadir) was significantly reduced in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Parkinson‚Äôs disease with concurrent rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and dementia with Lewy bodies (p {\textless} 0.001, p = 0.043 and p = 0.017, respectively). Importantly, this relationship was not seen in those patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between amplitude of the core body temperature and self-reported rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder symptoms. Changes in thermoregulatory circadian rhythm may be specifically associated with the pathology underlying rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder rather than simply that of Œ±-synucleinopathy. These findings implicate thermoregulatory dysfunction as a potential early biomarker for development of rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder-associated neurodegeneration, and suggest that subpopulations with differing pathological underpinnings might exist in Parkinson‚Äôs disease.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13075-019-2047-z},
	abstract = {Background: 
In the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, inflammation readouts are usually quantified using operator-dependent clinical scoring systems, and no systematic relationship with functional deficits has been detected. In this study, we extensively quantified sensory and motor deficits in CIA mice during natural disease progression and therapeutic treatment. Then, we used these data to build a scale to predict functional deficits on the basis of the classical clinical score.

Methods:
Using the CIA mouse model, we longitudinally screened multiple approaches to assess locomotion (open field test, Catwalk‚Ñ¢), sensitivity (Von Frey, Hargreaves, static weight-bearing tests), and inflammation (skin temperature), and identified the most accurate tests to correlate sensory and motor deficits with disease severity, measured by clinical score. We then used these tests to characterize functional deficits in control (na√Øve and mice injected with complete Freund's adjuvant) and CIA mice, either untreated or treated with methotrexate to prevent functional deficits. By mathematical approaches, we finally investigated the relationship between functional deficits and clinical score.

Results:
We found that the functional disability scores obtained with the open field, Catwalk‚Ñ¢, Hargreaves, and skin temperature tests significantly correlated with the clinical score in CIA mice, either untreated or treated with methotrexate. Mathematical correlation showed that motor deficits, robustly characterized by two different tests, were twice more responsive than thermal sensitivity deficits.

Conclusion:
We propose the arthritis sensory and motor (ArthriSM) scale as a new theranostic tool to predict motor and sensory deficit based on the clinical score, in the experimental mouse model of CIA. This ArthriSM scale may facilitate the transfer of knowledge between preclinical and clinical studies.},

Evidence that sensors could be used to develop fever monitoring capabilities would enable large-scale health-monitoring research and provide high-temporal resolution data on fever responses across heterogeneous populations. We launched the TemPredict study in March of 2020 to capture continuous physiological data, including peripheral temperature, from a commercially available wearable device during the novel coronavirus pandemic. We coupled these data with symptom reports and COVID-19 diagnosis data. Here we report findings from the first 50 subjects who reported COVID-19 infections. These cases provide the first evidence¬†that illness-associated elevations in peripheral temperature are observable using wearable devices and correlate with self-reported fever. Our analyses support the hypothesis that wearable sensors can detect illnesses in the absence of symptom recognition. Finally, these data support the hypothesis that prediction of illness onset is possible using continuously generated physiological data collected by wearable sensors. Our findings should encourage further research into the role of wearable sensors in public health efforts aimed at illness detection, and underscore the importance of integrating temperature sensors into commercially available wearables.},

	abstract = {Core body temperature (CBT) is a key vital sign and fever is an important indicator of disease. In the past decade, there has been growing interest for vital sign monitoring technology that may be embedded in wearable devices, and the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for remote patient monitoring systems. While wrist-worn sensors allow continuous assessment of heart rate and oxygen saturation, reliable measurement of CBT at the wrist remains challenging. In this study, CBT was measured continuously in a free-living setting using a novel technology worn at the wrist and compared to reference core body temperature measurements, i.e., CBT values acquired with an ingestible temperature-sensing pill. Fifty individuals who received the COVID-19 booster vaccination were included. The datasets of 33 individuals were used to develop the CBT prediction algorithm, and the algorithm was then validated on the datasets of 17 participants. Mean observation time was 26.4¬†h and CBT‚Äâ{\textgreater}‚Äâ38.0¬†¬∞C occurred in 66\% of the participants. CBT predicted by the wrist-worn sensor showed good correlation to the reference CBT (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.72). Bland‚ÄìAltman statistics showed an average bias of 0.11¬†¬∞C of CBT predicted by the wrist-worn device compared to reference CBT, and limits of agreement were ‚àí¬†0.67 to‚Äâ+‚Äâ0.93¬†¬∞C, which is comparable to the bias and limits of agreement of commonly used tympanic membrane thermometers. The small size of the components needed for this technology would allow its integration into a variety of wearable monitoring systems assessing other vital signs and at the same time allowing maximal freedom of movement to the user.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Early treatment of sepsis improves survival, but early diagnosis of hospital-acquired sepsis, especially in critically ill patients, is challenging. Evidence suggests that subtle changes in body temperature patterns may be an early indicator of sepsis, but data is limited. The aim of this study was to examine whether abnormal body temperature patterns, as identified by visual examination, could predict the subsequent diagnosis of sepsis in afebrile critically ill patients.
METHODS: Retrospective case-control study of 32 septic and 29 non-septic patients in an adult medical and surgical ICU. Temperature curves for the period starting 72 hours and ending 8 hours prior to the clinical suspicion of sepsis (for septic patients) and for the 72-hour period prior to discharge from the ICU (for non-septic patients) were rated as normal or abnormal by seven blinded physicians. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare groups in regard to maximum temperature, minimum temperature, greatest change in temperature in any 24-hour period, and whether the majority of evaluators rated the curve to be abnormal.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the groups were similar except the septic group had more trauma patients (31.3\% vs. 6.9\%, p = .02) and more patients requiring mechanical ventilation (75.0\% vs. 41.4\%, p = .008). Multivariable logistic regression to control for baseline differences demonstrated that septic patients had significantly larger temperature deviations in any 24-hour period compared to control patients (1.5¬∞C vs. 1.1¬∞C, p = .02). An abnormal temperature pattern was noted by a majority of the evaluators in 22 (68.8\%) septic patients and 7 (24.1\%) control patients (adjusted OR 4.43, p = .017). This resulted in a sensitivity of 0.69 (95\% CI [confidence interval] 0.50, 0.83) and specificity of 0.76 (95\% CI 0.56, 0.89) of abnormal temperature curves to predict sepsis. The median time from the temperature plot to the first culture was 9.40 hours (IQR [inter-quartile range] 8.00, 18.20) and to the first dose of antibiotics was 16.90 hours (IQR 8.35, 34.20).
CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal body temperature curves were predictive of the diagnosis of sepsis in afebrile critically ill patients. Analysis of temperature patterns, rather than absolute values, may facilitate decreased time to antimicrobial therapy.},

	abstract = {The twenty-four hour sleep-wake pattern known as the rest-activity rhythm (RAR) is associated with many aspects of health and well-being. Researchers have utilized a number of interpretable, person-specific RAR measures that can be estimated from actigraphy. Actigraphs are wearable devices that dynamically record acceleration and provide indirect measures of physical activity over time. One class of useful RAR measures are those that quantify variability around a mean circadian pattern. However, current parametric and non-parametric RAR measures used by applied researchers can only quantify variability from a limited or undefined number of rhythmic sources. The primary goal of this article is to consider a new measure of RAR variability: the log-power spectrum of stochastic error around a circadian mean. This functional measure quantifies the relative contributions of variability about a circadian mean from all possibly frequencies, including weekly, daily, and high-frequency sources of variation. It can be estimated through a two-stage procedure that smooths the log-periodogram of residuals after estimating a circadian mean. The development of this measure was motivated by a study of depression in older adults and revealed that slow, rhythmic variations in activity from a circadian pattern are correlated with depression symptoms.},

	abstract = {Objective:
To investigate whether age-related and experimental reductions in SWS and sleep continuity are associated with increased daytime sleep propensity.

Methods:
Assessment of daytime sleep propensity under baseline conditions and following experimental disruption of SWS. Healthy young (20-30 y, n = 44), middle-aged (40-55 y, n = 35) and older (66-83 y, n = 31) men and women, completed a 2-way parallel group study. After an 8-h baseline sleep episode, subjects were randomized to 2 nights with selective SWS disruption by acoustic stimuli, or without disruption, followed by 1 recovery night. Objective and subjective sleep propensity were assessed using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS).

Findings:
During baseline sleep, SWS decreased (P {\textless} 0.001) and the number of awakenings increased (P {\textless} 0.001) across the 3 age groups. During the baseline day, MSLT values increased across the three age groups (P {\textless} 0.0001) with mean values of 8.7min (SD: 4.5), 11.7 (5.1) and 14.2 (4.1) in the young, middle-aged, and older adults, respectively. KSS values were 3.7 (1.0), 3.2 (0.9), and 3.4 (0.6) (age-group: P = 0.031). Two nights of SWS disruption led to a reduction in MSLT and increase in KSS in all 3 age groups (SWS disruption vs. control: P {\textless} 0.05 in all cases).

Conclusions:
Healthy aging is associated with a reduction in daytime sleep propensity, sleep continuity, and SWS. In contrast, experimental disruption of SWS leads to an increase in daytime sleep propensity. The age-related decline in SWS and reduction in daytime sleep propensity may reflect a lessening in homeostatic sleep requirement. Healthy older adults without sleep disorders can expect to be less sleepy during the daytime than young adults.

Ten weeks later, animals were subjected to 30-min myocardial ischemia plus 120-min reperfusion. Infarct size (IS) and no-reflow area were determined histochemically. Fasting plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), leptin, ghrelin, and insulin were measured using ELISA. Compared with SHAM, RYGB and SG reduced IS by 22\% (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.011) and 10\% (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.027), and no-reflow by 38\% (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01) and 32\% (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.004), respectively. IT failed to reduce IS and no-reflow. GLP-1 level was increased in the SG and RYGB groups compared with CON. In both the SG and RYGB, leptin level was decreased compared with CON and SHAM. In the SG group, ghrelin level was lower than that in the CON and SHAM. Insulin levels were not different between groups. In conclusion, RYGB and SG increased myocardial tolerance to ischemia‚Äìreperfusion injury of non-obese, non-diabetic rats, and their infarct-limiting effect is associated with decreased leptin and ghrelin levels and increased GLP-1 level.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Previous laboratory studies in narcolepsy patients showed altered core body and skin temperatures, which are hypothesised to be related to a disturbed sleep wake regulation. In this ambulatory study we assessed temperature profiles in normal daily life, and whether sleep attacks are heralded by changes in skin temperature. Furthermore, the effects of three months of treatment with sodium oxybate (SXB) were investigated.
METHODS: Twenty-five narcolepsy patients and 15 healthy controls were included. Core body, proximal and distal skin temperatures, and sleep-wake state were measured simultaneously for 24 hours in ambulatory patients. This procedure was repeated in 16 narcolepsy patients after at least 3 months of stable treatment with SXB.
RESULTS: Increases in distal skin temperature and distal-to-proximal temperature gradient (DPG) strongly predicted daytime sleep attacks (P {\textless} 0.001). As compared to controls, patients had a higher proximal and distal skin temperature in the morning, and a lower distal skin temperature during the night (all P {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, they had a higher core body temperature during the first part of the night (P {\textless} 0.05), which SXB decreased (F = 4.99, df = 1, P = 0.03) to a level similar to controls. SXB did not affect skin temperature.
CONCLUSIONS: This ambulatory study demonstrates that daytime sleep attacks were preceded by clear changes in distal skin temperature and DPG. Furthermore, changes in core body and skin temperature in narcolepsy, previously only studied in laboratory settings, were partially confirmed. Treatment with SXB resulted in a normalisation of the core body temperature profile. Future studies should explore whether predictive temperature changes can be used to signal or even prevent sleep attacks.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The concept of multi-dimensional sleep health, originally based on self-report, was recently extended to actigraphy in older adults, yielding five components, but without a hypothesized rhythmicity factor. The current study extends prior work using a sample of older adults with a longer period of actigraphy follow-up, which may facilitate observation of the rhythmicity factor.
Methods
Wrist actigraphy measures of participants (N¬†=¬†289, Mage =¬†77.2 years, 67\% females; 47\% White, 40\% Black, 13\% Hispanic/Others) over 2 weeks were used in exploratory factor analysis¬†to determine factor structures, followed by confirmatory factor analysis on a different subsample. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by associations with global cognitive performance (Montreal Cognitive Assessment).
Results
Exploratory factor analysis identified¬†six factors: Regularity: standard deviations of four sleep measures: midpoint, sleep onset time, night total sleep time (TST), and 24-hour TST; Alertness/Sleepiness (daytime): amplitude, napping (mins and \#/day); Timing: sleep onset, midpoint, wake-time (of nighttime sleep); up-mesor, acrophase, down-mesor; Efficiency: sleep maintenance efficiency, wake after sleep onset; Duration: night rest interval(s), night TST, 24-hour rest interval(s), 24-hour TST; Rhythmicity (pattern across days): mesor, alpha, and minimum. Greater sleep efficiency was associated with better Montreal Cognitive Assessment performance (Œ≤ [95\% confidence interval]¬†=¬†0.63 [0.19, 1.08]).
Conclusions
Actigraphic records over 2 weeks revealed that Rhythmicity may be an independent factor in sleep health. Facets of sleep health can facilitate dimension reduction, be considered predictors of health outcomes, and be potential targets for sleep interventions.},

To systematically investigate the relationship between objective measures of physical capacity (e.g., cardio-respiratory fitness or daily step count) and biological age, measured in different ways.
Data source
PubMed; SCOPUS - Elsevier API; and Web of Science - ISI 1984-present, as well as contextual search engines used to identify additional relevant publications.
Study selection
Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that assessed the association between objectively measured physical capacity and biological aging in adult individuals (age{\textgreater}18).
Results
Analysis of 28 studies demonstrated that physical capacity is positively associated with biological aging; the most dominant measures of physical capacity are muscular strength or gait speed. The majority of the studies estimated biological aging by a single methodology ‚Äì either Leukocyte Telomere Length or DNA methylation levels.
Conclusions
This systematic review of the objective physical capacity measures used to estimate aging finds that the current literature is limited insofar as it overlooks the potential contribution of many feasible markers. We recommend measuring physical capacity in the context of aging using a wide range of modifiable behavioral markers, beyond simple muscle strength or simple gait speed. Forming a feasible and diversified method for estimating physical capacity through which it will also be possible to estimate biological aging in wide population studies is essential for the development of interventions that may alleviate the burden of age-related disease.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are known to be important drivers of human activity and the recent availability of electronic records of human behaviour has provided fine-grained data of temporal patterns of activity on a large scale. Further, questionnaire studies have identified important individual differences in circadian rhythms, with people broadly categorised into morning-like or evening-like individuals. However, little is known about the social aspects of these circadian rhythms, or how they vary across individuals. In this study we use a unique 18-month dataset that combines mobile phone calls and questionnaire data to examine individual differences in the daily rhythms of mobile phone activity. We demonstrate clear individual differences in daily patterns of phone calls, and show that these individual differences are persistent despite a high degree of turnover in the individuals‚Äô social networks. Further, women‚Äôs calls were longer than men‚Äôs calls, especially during the evening and at night, and these calls were typically focused on a small number of emotionally intense relationships. These results demonstrate that individual differences in circadian rhythms are not just related to broad patterns of morningness and eveningness, but have a strong social component, in directing phone calls to specific individuals at specific times of day.},

	abstract = {How circadian rhythms of activity manifest themselves in social life of humans remains one of the most intriguing questions in chronobiology and a major issue for personalized medicine. Over the past years, substantial advances have been made in understanding the personal nature and the robustness‚Äîi.e. the persistence‚Äîof the circadian rhythms of social activity by the analysis of phone use. At this stage however, the consistency of such advances as their statistical validity remains unclear. The present paper has been specifically designed to address this issue. To this end, we propose a novel statistical procedure for the measurement of the circadian rhythms of social activity which is particularly well-suited for the existing framework of persistence analysis. Furthermore, we illustrate how this procedure works concretely by assessing the persistence of the circadian rhythms of telephone call activity from a 12-month call detail records (CDRs) dataset of adults over than 65¬†years. The results show the ability of our approach for assessing persistence with a statistical significance. In the field of CDRs analysis, this novel statistical approach can be used for completing the existing methods used to analyze the persistence of the circadian rhythms of a social nature. More importantly, it provides an opportunity to open up the analysis of CDRs for various domains of application in personalized medicine requiring access to statistical significance such as health care monitoring.},

Using the largest accelerometer cohort to date, we aimed to investigate whether there is an association between disease status and accelerometer variables after a 5-year follow-up.
METHODS: 106,053 UK Biobank participants wore a wrist-worn GENEactiv monitor. Those with acceptable wear time ({\textgreater}‚Äâ3¬†days) were split into 4 cardio-metabolic disease groups based on self-report disease status which was collected 5‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1¬†years prior. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate associations, controlling for confounders and stratified for gender.
RESULTS: Average daily acceleration was lower in men ('healthy'-42‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ15¬†mg v 'Type 2 diabetes‚Äâ+‚Äâcardiovascular disease (CVD)'-31‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ12¬†mg) and women ('healthy'-44‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ13¬†mg v 'Type 2 diabetes‚Äâ+‚ÄâCVD'-31‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ11¬†mg) with cardio-metabolic disease and this was consistent across both week and weekend days. Men and women with the worst cardio-metabolic disease perform around half of moderate to vigorous physical activity on a daily basis compared to healthy individuals, and spend almost 7¬†h per day in 30¬†min inactivity bouts. Significant associations were seen between cardio-metabolic disease and accelerometer variables 5¬†years on when controlling for confounders.
CONCLUSION: In the largest accelerometer cohort to date, there are significant associations between cardio-metabolic disease and physical activity variables after 5¬†years of follow-up. Triaxial accelerometers provide enhanced measurement opportunities for measuring lifestyle behaviours in chronic disease.},

Here we use a unique 18-mo dataset that combines mobile phone calls and survey data to track changes in the ego networks and communication patterns of students making the transition from school to university or work. Our analysis reveals that individuals display a distinctive and robust social signature, captured by how interactions are distributed across different alters. Notably, for a given ego, these social signatures tend to persist over time, despite considerable turnover in the identity of alters in the ego network. Thus, as new network members are added, some old network members either are replaced or receive fewer calls, preserving the overall distribution of calls across network members. This is likely to reflect the consequences of finite resources such as the time available for communication, the cognitive and emotional effort required to sustain close relationships, and the ability to make emotional investments.},

We aim to investigate the association of accelerometer-measured circadian rest-activity rhythm (CRAR, the most prominent circadian rhythm in humans) with the risk of AF, and examine joint associations and potential interactions of CRAR and genetic susceptibility with AF incidence. We include 62,927 white British participants of UK Biobank without AF at baseline. CRAR characteristics, including amplitude (strength), acrophase (timing of peak activity), pseudo-F (robustness), and mesor (height), are derived by applying an extended cosine model. Genetic risk is assessed with polygenic risk scores. The outcome is the incidence of AF. During a median follow-up of 6.16 years, 1920 participants developed AF. Low amplitude [hazard ratio (HR): 1.41, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.25‚Äì1.58], delayed acrophase (HR: 1.24, 95\% CI: 1.10‚Äì1.39), and low mesor (HR: 1.36, 95\% CI: 1.21‚Äì1.52), but not low pseudo-F, are significantly associated with a higher risk of AF. No significant interactions between CRAR characteristics and genetic risk are observed. Joint association analyses reveal that participants with unfavourable CRAR characteristics and high genetic risk yield the highest risk of incident AF. These associations are robust after controlling for multiple testing and in a series of sensitivity analyses. Accelerometer-measured CRAR abnormalities, characterized by decreased strength and height, and later timing of peak activity of circadian rhythm, are associated with a higher risk of AF in the general population.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Abnormally short and long sleep are associated with premature mortality, and achieving optimal sleep duration has been the focus of sleep health guidelines. Emerging research demonstrates that sleep regularity, the day-to-day consistency of sleep‚Äìwake timing, can be a stronger predictor for some health outcomes than sleep duration. The role of sleep regularity in mortality, however, has not been investigated in a large cohort with objective data. We therefore aimed to compare how sleep regularity and duration predicted risk for all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We calculated Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) scores from‚ÄÖ\&gt;‚ÄÖ10 million hours of accelerometer data in 60 977 UK Biobank participants (62.8‚ÄÖ¬±‚ÄÖ7.8 years, 55.0\% female, median[IQR] SRI: 81.0[73.8‚Äì86.3]). Mortality was reported up to 7.8 years after accelerometer recording in 1859 participants (4.84 deaths per 1000 person-years, mean (¬±SD) follow-up of 6.30‚ÄÖ¬±‚ÄÖ0.83 years). Higher sleep regularity was associated with a 20\%‚Äì48\% lower risk of all-cause mortality (p‚ÄÖ\&lt;‚ÄÖ.001 to p‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ0.004), a 16\%‚Äì39\% lower risk of cancer mortality (p‚ÄÖ\&lt;‚ÄÖ0.001 to p‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ0.017), and a 22\%‚Äì57\% lower risk of cardiometabolic mortality (p‚ÄÖ\&lt;‚ÄÖ0.001 to p‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ0.048), across the top four SRI quintiles compared to the least regular quintile. Results were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health factors. Sleep regularity was a stronger predictor of all-cause mortality than sleep duration, by comparing equivalent mortality models, and by comparing nested SRI-mortality models with and without sleep duration (p‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ0.14‚Äì0.20). These findings indicate that sleep regularity is an important predictor of mortality risk and is a stronger predictor than sleep duration. Sleep regularity may be a simple, effective target for improving general health and survival.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives
Sleep regularity predicts many health-related outcomes. Currently, however, there is no systematic approach to measuring sleep regularity. Traditionally, metrics have assessed deviations in sleep patterns from an individual‚Äôs average; these traditional metrics include intra-individual standard deviation (StDev), interdaily stability (IS), and social jet lag (SJL). Two metrics were recently proposed that instead measure variability between consecutive days: composite phase deviation (CPD) and sleep regularity index (SRI). Using large-scale simulations, we investigated the theoretical properties of these five metrics.

Methods
Multiple sleep‚Äìwake patterns were systematically simulated, including variability in daily sleep timing and/or duration. Average estimates and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated for six scenarios that affect the measurement of sleep regularity: ‚Äúscrambling‚Äù the order of days; daily vs. weekly variation; naps; awakenings; ‚Äúall-nighters‚Äù; and length of study.

Results
SJL measured weekly but not daily changes. Scrambling did not affect StDev or IS, but did affect CPD and SRI; these metrics, therefore, measure sleep regularity on multi-day and day-to-day timescales, respectively. StDev and CPD did not capture sleep fragmentation. IS and SRI behaved similarly in response to naps and awakenings but differed markedly for all-nighters. StDev and IS required over a week of sleep‚Äìwake data for unbiased estimates, whereas CPD and SRI required larger sample sizes to detect group differences.

Conclusions
Deciding which sleep regularity metric is most appropriate for a given study depends on a combination of the type of data gathered, the study length and sample size, and which aspects of sleep regularity are most pertinent to the research question.},

SSD (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ137 altogether, N‚Äâ=‚Äâ79 residential and N‚Äâ=‚Äâ58 outpatients) and healthy control (HC) subjects (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ113) were recruited for the DiAPAson project. Participants wore an ActiGraph for seven consecutive days to monitor habitual sleep-RAR patterns. Sleep/rest duration, activity (i.e., M10, calculated on the 10 most active hours), rhythm fragmentation within days (i.e., intra-daily variability, IV; beta, steepness of rest-active changes), and rhythm regularity across days (i.e., inter-daily stability, IS) were computed in each study participant. Negative symptoms were assessed in SSD patients with the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS). Both SSD groups showed lower M10 and longer sleep/rest duration vs. HC, while only residential patients had more fragmented and irregular rhythms than HC. Compared to outpatients, residential patients had lower M10 and higher beta, IV and IS. Furthermore, residential patients had worse BNSS scores relative to outpatients, and higher IS contributed to between-group differences in BNSS score severity. Altogether, residentials and outpatients SSD had both shared and unique abnormalities in Sleep/RAR measures vs. HC and relative to one another, which also contributed to the patients‚Äô negative symptom severity. Future work will help establish whether improving some of these measures may ameliorate the quality of life and clinical symptoms of SSD patients.},

Despite high prevalence of these conditions, few validated biomarkers exist to predict kidney dysfunction. In this study, we utilized a novel kidney multiplex panel to measure 21 proteins in plasma and urine to characterize the spectrum of biomarker profiles in kidney disease. Blood and urine samples were obtained from age-/sex-matched healthy control subjects (HC), critically-ill COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), and patients with chronic or end-stage kidney disease (CKD/ESKD). Biomarkers were measured with a kidney multiplex panel, and results analyzed with conventional statistics and machine learning. Correlations were examined between biomarkers and patient clinical and laboratory variables. Median AKI subject age was 65.5 (IQR 58.5‚Äì73.0) and median CKD/ESKD age was 65.0 (IQR 50.0‚Äì71.5). Of the CKD/ESKD patients, 76.1\% were on hemodialysis, 14.3\% of patients had kidney transplant, and 9.5\% had CKD without kidney replacement therapy. In plasma, 19 proteins were significantly different in titer between the HC versus AKI versus CKD/ESKD groups, while NAG and RBP4 were unchanged. TIMP-1 (PPV 1.0, NPV 1.0), best distinguished AKI from HC, and TFF3 (PPV 0.99, NPV 0.89) best distinguished CKD/ESKD from HC. In urine, 18 proteins were significantly different between groups except Calbindin, Osteopontin and TIMP-1. Osteoactivin (PPV 0.95, NPV 0.95) best distinguished AKI from HC, and Œ≤2-microglobulin (PPV 0.96, NPV 0.78) best distinguished CKD/ESKD from HC. A variety of correlations were noted between patient variables and either plasma or urine biomarkers. Using a novel kidney multiplex biomarker panel, together with conventional statistics and machine learning, we identified unique biomarker profiles in the plasma and urine of patients with AKI and CKD/ESKD. We demonstrated correlations between biomarker profiles and patient clinical variables. Our exploratory study provides biomarker data for future hypothesis driven research on kidney disease.},

Salivary concentrations of hyaluronic acid (HA), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and Œ±-2-macroglobulin (A2MG) were significantly increased (p¬†{\textless}¬†0.05) in patients with liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. By combining these biomarkers, we developed the Saliva Liver Fibrosis (SALF) score, which identified patients with liver¬†cirrhosis with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.970 and 0.920 in a discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. The SALF score had a performance that was similar to that of the current Fibrosis-4 (AUROC:0.740) and Hepascore (AUROC:0.979). We demonstrated the clinical utility of saliva to diagnose liver fibrosis/cirrhosis with a potential to improve the screening for cirrhosis in asymptomatic populations.},

Anti-tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±) agents are important treatments for IBD. We investigated whether microbiome changes at multiple sites can predict the effectiveness of such treatment in IBD.

Microbiota analysis was performed using extracellular vesicles (EVs; all four sample types) and next-generation sequencing (NGS; stool and saliva). The stool, using NGS analysis, was the only sample type in which Œ±-diversity differed significantly between the IBD and control groups at V1 and V2. Relative to non-responders, responders to anti-TNF-Œ± treatment had significantly higher levels of Firmicutes (phylum), Clostridia (class), and Ruminococcaceae (family) in V1 stool, and Prevotella in V1 saliva. Non-responders had significantly higher V2 serum and urine levels of Lachnospiraceae than responders. Finally, Acidovorax caeni was detected in all V1 sample types in responders, but was not detected in non-responders. Microbiome changes at multiple sites may predict the effectiveness of anti-TNF-Œ± treatment in IBD, warranting further research.},

Sleep and wake times show a near-Gaussian distribution in a given population, with extreme early types waking up when extreme late types fall asleep. This distribution is predominantly based on differences in an individuals‚Äô circadian clock. The relationship between the circadian system and different ‚Äúchronotypes‚Äù is formally and genetically well established in experimental studies in organisms ranging from unicells to mammals. To investigate the epidemiology of the human circadian clock, we developed a simple questionnaire (Munich ChronoType Questionnaire, MCTQ) to assess chronotype. So far, more than 55,000 people have completed the MCTQ, which has been validated with respect to the Horne‚Äì√òstberg morningness‚Äìeveningness questionnaire (MEQ), objective measures of activity and rest (sleep-logs and actimetry), and physiological parameters. As a result of this large survey, we established an algorithm which optimises chronotype assessment by incorporating the information on timing of sleep and wakefulness for both work and free days. The timing and duration of sleep are generally independent. However, when the two are analysed separately for work and free days, sleep duration strongly depends on chronotype. In addition, chronotype is both age- and sex-dependent.},

	abstract = {Background/Objectives
To determine effects of gender, age, diet, and smoking status on circadian rhythm characteristics of ascorbic acid (vitamin C).
Subjects/Methods
Ascorbic acid was measured spectrophotometrically in serum collected from 162 healthy volunteers (103 males and 59 females; 7‚Äì75 years) every 6h for 24h (4 samples). Data were analyzed by single and population mean cosinor. Effects of gender, age, diet (vegetarian vs. omnivore), and smoking status on the rhythm-adjusted mean (MESOR) and circadian amplitude were examined by multiple analysis of variance.
Results
A circadian rhythm is documented with statistical significance by population mean cosinor. In addition to effects of gender and age, the MESOR is affected by diet and smoking status. The circadian amplitude changes nonlinearly as a function of age. The circadian acrophase advances with increasing age.
Conclusion
The present observations confirm a definite circadian rhythm in ascorbic acid concentrations with significant effects of age, diet and smoking status in clinical health. Mapping the circadian rhythm of serum ascorbic acid in health can help explore its role in different pathophysiological conditions as pre-disease conditions may be characterized by alterations in the circadian amplitude and/or phase before there is a change in mean value.},

The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between employment status and job activity level with physical activity (PA) and sedentary time, stratified by gender and country.
Design
Cross-sectional study design.
Methods
Data from working age adults (18‚àí65 years) from two cross-sectional studies, the Swedish 2001‚àí2002 and 2007‚àí2008 Attitude Behavior and Change Study (ABC; n=1165) and the 2003‚àí2006 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; n=4201), were stratified by employment status (employed and not employed) and job activity level (active, sedentary and mixed). PA in counts√ómin‚àí1 and time spent in sedentary, low and moderate or higher intensity were measured with accelerometers. Analyses were conducted in 2012‚Äì2013.
Results
In NHANES, the employed had significantly higher counts√ómin‚àí1 and spent more time in moderate or higher intensity PA than those not employed. In ABC, no significant differences were observed between employed and unemployed. Adults with active versus sedentary occupations had higher counts√ómin‚àí1 and less sedentary time in both the USA and Sweden and in both men and women. For example, counts√ómin‚àí1 were 20‚àí40\% greater in active versus sedentary jobs.
Conclusions
Employment status is related to PA and sedentary time among men and women in the USA but not in Sweden. Among the employed, occupational PA is associated with total PA and sedentary time for both genders and in both countries. Comparisons of PA levels based on objective measurements can refine understanding of country differences in activity.},

Results from individual-level data are consistent with group-average results.

	abstract = {Background
Sleep and circadian disruption are associated with depression onset and severity, but it is unclear which features (e.g., sleep duration, chronotype) are important and whether they can identify individuals showing poorer outcomes.
Methods
Within a subset of the UK Biobank with actigraphy and mental health data (n¬†=¬†64,353), penalised regression identified the most useful of 51 sleep/rest-activity predictors of depression-related outcomes; including case-control (Major Depression (MD) vs. controls; postnatal depression vs. controls) and within-case comparisons (severe vs. moderate MD; early vs. later onset, atypical vs. typical symptoms; comorbid anxiety; suicidality). Best models (of lasso, ridge, and elastic net) were selected based on Area Under the Curve (AUC).
Results
For MD vs. controls (n(MD)¬†=¬†24,229; n(control)¬†=¬†40,124), lasso AUC was 0.68, 95¬†\% confidence interval (CI) 0.67‚Äì0.69. Discrimination was reasonable for atypical vs. typical symptoms (n(atypical)¬†=¬†958; n(typical)¬†=¬†18,722; ridge: AUC 0.74, 95¬†\% CI 0.71‚Äì0.77) but poor for remaining models (AUCs 0.59‚Äì0.67). Key predictors across most models included: difficulty getting up, insomnia symptoms, snoring, actigraphy-measured daytime inactivity and lower morning activity ({\textasciitilde}8¬†am). In a distinct subset (n¬†=¬†310,718), the number of these factors shown was associated with all depression outcomes.
Limitations
Analyses were cross-sectional and in middle-/older aged adults: comparison with longitudinal investigations and younger cohorts is necessary.
Discussion
Sleep and circadian measures alone provided poor to moderate discrimination of depression outcomes, but several characteristics were identified that may be clinically useful. Future work should assess these features alongside broader sociodemographic, lifestyle and genetic features.},

	abstract = {Background Recent cross-sectional studies have suggested a link between sleep disturbance and worse neurocognitive function. We hypothesized that sleep disturbance traits (short/long habitual sleep duration, insomnia, daytime somnolence, and napping), and sleep apnea were linked to the development of incident Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) in a large, prospective cohort spanning over a decade. Method We studied 502,538 participants from the UK Biobank, free from AD at baseline (mean age 57, range: 37-73), who have been followed for up to 12 years. AD date of diagnosis was obtained through algorithmic combinations of coded information from hospital admissions (diagnoses and procedures) and death registries. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to examine the association between sleep disturbance with incident AD during follow-up. Sleep disturbance traits include: self-reported sleep duration (short {\textless}6hrs/intermediate 6-9h/long{\textgreater}9h), daytime somnolence (often/rarely), napping (usually/rarely). Sleep apnea presence was derived from ICD-10 diagnosis and/or self-report. Our core models with individual sleep disturbance traits were adjusted for age, sex, education, and ethnicity. The full model adjusted for major comorbidities [the Townsend deprivation index - a measure of socioeconomic status, body mass index, physical activity, major cardiovascular diseases and risk factors (hypertension, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, AF, angina/MI, peripheral vascular disease), neurological diseases (stroke/TIA, dementia, Parkinson‚Äôs), respiratory diseases (COPD, fibrosis), alcohol use, depression/anxiety, and medication use (benzodiazepines, sedatives/sleep aides, antipsychotics, steroids and opioids)]. Result In total, 932 developed AD after 6.4 years (SD=1.9). In our full model, long habitual sleep ({\textgreater}9h), but not short sleep ({\textless}6h), saw a two-fold increased risk (HR 2.04, 95\% CI: 1.55-2.67 p{\textless}0.0001) compared to intermediate sleep (6-9h) duration. Daytime somnolence was independently predictive of AD (HR 1.56, 95\% CI: 1.18-2.03, p=0.001). These effects remained after controlling for sleep apnea, which was only predictive in the core model (HR 2.05, 95\% CI: 1.23-3.42, p=0.006). Conclusion Long habitual sleep duration and daytime somnolence may be early, independent markers of AD. Further work examining objective measures of sleep duration and sleep disturbance within this population is ongoing, and may help confirm our findings. If replicated, future trials may be warranted to test whether optimizing sleep health reduces the risk of developing AD.},

	abstract = {Non-communicable diseases, including diabetes, are partly responsible for the deceleration of improvements of life expectancy in many countries. Diabetes is also associated with sleep disturbances. Our aim was to determine whether sleep disturbances, particularly in people with diabetes, were associated with increased mortality risk. Data from the UK Biobank were analysed (n = 487,728, mean follow-up time = 8.9 years). The primary exposure was sleep disturbances, assessed through the question: Do you have trouble falling asleep at night or do you wake up in the middle of the night? The primary outcome was mortality. We also dichotomized sleep disturbances into ‚Äúnever/sometimes‚Äù versus ‚Äúusually‚Äù (frequently), and combined with the presence/absence of diabetes: 24.2\% of participants reported ‚Äúnever/rarely‚Äù experiencing sleep disturbances, 47.8\% ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù and 28.0\% ‚Äúusually‚Äù. In age- and sex-adjusted models, frequent sleep disturbances were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.26‚Äì1.37), which remained significant in the fully adjusted model (HR 1.13, 95\% CI 1.09‚Äì1.18). The presence of both diabetes and frequent sleep disturbances was associated with greater risk of all-cause mortality than either condition alone. In the fully adjusted model, the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.11 (95\% CI, 1.07‚Äì1.15) for frequent sleep disturbances alone, 1.67 (95\% CI, 1.57‚Äì1.76) for diabetes alone and 1.87 for both (95\% CI, 1.75‚Äì2.01). Frequent sleep disturbances (experienced by more than one quarter of the sample) were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Mortality risk was highest in those with both diabetes and frequent sleep disturbances. Complaints of difficulty falling or staying asleep merit attention by physicians.},

In contrast, when adjusted for covariates including CRF, MVPA was positively associated with left and right hippocampal (FDR pleft‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01; FDR pright‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.02) volumes, but not overall gray matter volume. Both CRF and MVPA were inversely associated with white matter hyperintensity lesion loads (FDR pCRF‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002; pMVPA‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.02). Our results suggest separable effects of engagement in exercise behaviors (MVPA) and the physiological effects of exercise (CRF) on structural brain volumes, which may have implications for differential pathways linking exercise and brain benefits.},

	abstract = {Background Physical activity has not been objectively measured in prospective cohorts with sufficiently large numbers to reliably detect associations with multiple health outcomes. Technological advances now make this possible. We describe the methods used to collect and analyse accelerometer measured physical activity in over 100,000 participants of the UK Biobank study, and report variation by age, sex, day, time of day, and season. Methods Participants were approached by email to wear a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven days that was posted to them. Physical activity information was extracted from 100Hz raw triaxial acceleration data after calibration, removal of gravity and sensor noise, and identification of wear / non-wear episodes. We report age- and sex-specific wear-time compliance and accelerometer measured physical activity, overall and by hour-of-day, week-weekend day and season. Results 103,712 datasets were received (44.8\% response), with a median wear-time of 6.9 days (IQR:6.5‚Äì7.0). 96,600 participants (93.3\%) provided valid data for physical activity analyses. Vector magnitude, a proxy for overall physical activity, was 7.5\% (2.35mg) lower per decade of age (Cohen‚Äôs d = 0.9). Women had a higher vector magnitude than men, apart from those aged 45-54yrs. There were major differences in vector magnitude by time of day (d = 0.66). Vector magnitude differences between week and weekend days (d = 0.12 for men, d = 0.09 for women) and between seasons (d = 0.27 for men, d = 0.15 for women) were small. Conclusions It is feasible to collect and analyse objective physical activity data in large studies. The summary measure of overall physical activity is lower in older participants and age-related differences in activity are most prominent in the afternoon and evening. This work lays the foundation for studies of physical activity and its health consequences. Our summary variables are part of the UK Biobank dataset and can be used by researchers as exposures, confounding factors or outcome variables in future analyses.},

	abstract = {Purpose

The purpose of this study was to examine patterns of objectively-measured sedentary behavior in a national cohort of U.S. middle-aged and older adults and determine factors that influence prolonged sedentary behavior.

Methods

We studied 8,096 participants from the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study, a population-based study of black and white adults ‚â•45 years. Seven-day accelerometry was conducted. Prolonged sedentary behavior was defined as accumulating ‚â•50\% of total sedentary time in bouts ‚â•30 min.

Results

The number of sedentary bouts ‚â•20, ‚â•30, ‚â•60, and ‚â•90 min were 8.8 ¬± 2.3, 5.5 ¬± 1.9, 1.9 ¬± 1.1, and 0.8 ¬± 0.7 bouts/day, respectively. Sedentary bouts ‚â•20, ‚â•30, ‚â•60, and ‚â•90 min accounted for 60.0 ¬± 13.9\%, 48.0 ¬± 15.5\%, 26.0 ¬± 15.4\%, and 14.2 ¬± 12.9\% of total sedentary time, respectively. Several factors were associated with prolonged sedentary behavior in multivariate-adjusted models (Odds Ratio [95\% CI]): older age (65-74 years: 1.99 [1.55-2.57]; ‚â•75 years: 4.68 [3.61-6.07] vs. 45-54 years), male sex (1.41 [1.28-1.56] vs. female), residence in non-stroke belt/buckle region of U.S. (stroke belt: 0.87 [0.77-0.98]; stroke buckle: 0.86 [0.77-0.95] vs. non-belt/buckle), body mass index (BMI) (overweight: 1.33 [1.18-1.51]; obese: 2.15 [1.89-2.44] vs. normal weight), winter (1.18 [1.03-1.35] vs. summer), and low amounts of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) [0 min/week: 2.00 [1.66-2.40] vs. ‚â•150 min/week).

Conclusions

In this sample of U.S. middle-aged and older adults, a large proportion of total sedentary time was accumulated in prolonged, uninterrupted bouts of sedentary behavior as almost one-half was accumulated in sedentary bouts ‚â•30 min. Several sociodemographic (age, sex, BMI), behavioral (MVPA), environmental (region), and seasonal factors are associated with patterns of prolonged sedentary behavior},

	abstract = {This article reviews the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in model selection and the appraisal of psychological theory. The focus is on latent variable models, given their growing use in theory testing and construction. Theoretical statistical results in regression are discussed, and more important issues are illustrated with novel simulations involving latent variable models including factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and factor mixture models. Asymptotically, the BIC is consistent, in that it will select the true model if, among other assumptions, the true model is among the candidate models considered. The AIC is not consistent under these circumstances. When the true model is not in the candidate model set the AIC is efficient, in that it will asymptotically choose whichever model minimizes the mean squared error of prediction/estimation. The BIC is not efficient under these circumstances. Unlike the BIC, the AIC also has a minimax property, in that it can minimize the maximum possible risk in finite sample sizes. In sum, the AIC and BIC have quite different properties that require different assumptions, and applied researchers and methodologists alike will benefit from improved understanding of the asymptotic and finite-sample behavior of these criteria. The ultimate decision to use the AIC or BIC depends on many factors, including the loss function employed, the study's methodological design, the substantive research question, and the notion of a true model and its applicability to the study at hand.

	abstract = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a field with many contrasting application domains, from medical applications to ambient assisted living and sports applications. With ever-changing use cases and devices also comes a need for newer and better HAR approaches. Machine learning has long been one of the predominant techniques to recognize activities from extracted features. With the advent of deep learning techniques that push state of the art results in many different domains like natural language processing or computer vision, researchers have also started to build deep neural nets for HAR. With this increase in complexity, there also comes a necessity to compare the newer approaches to the previous state of the art algorithms. Not everything that is new is also better. Therefore, this paper aims to compare typical machine learning models like a Random Forest (RF) or a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to two commonly used deep neural net architectures, Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs). Not only in regards to performance but also in regards to the complexity of the models. We measure complexity as the memory consumption, the mean prediction time and the number of trainable parameters of the models. To achieve comparable results, the models are all tested on the same publicly available dataset, the UCI HAR Smartphone dataset. With this combination of prediction performance and model complexity, we look for the models achieving the best possible performance/complexity tradeoff and therefore being the most favourable to be used in an application. According to our findings, the best model for a strictly memory limited use case is the Random Forest with an F1-Score of 88.34\%, memory consumption of only 0.1 MB and mean prediction time of 0.22 ms. The overall best model in terms of complexity and performance is the SVM with a linear kernel with an F1-Score of 95.62\%, memory consumption of 2 MB and a mean prediction time of 0.47 ms. The two deep neural nets are on par in terms of performance, but their increased complexity makes them less favourable to be used.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with hypertension (DH) is the most common diabetic comorbidity. Patients with DH have significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a nomogram model for the prediction of an individual's risk of developing DH. A total of 706 T2DM patients who met the criteria were selected and divided into a training set (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ521) and a validation set (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ185) according to the discharge time of patients. By using multivariate logistic regression analysis and stepwise regression, the DH nomogram prediction model was created. Calibration curves were used to evaluate the model's accuracy, while decision curve analysis (DCA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the model's clinical applicability and discriminatory power. Age, body mass index (BMI), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and diabetic retinopathy (DR) were all independent risk factors for DH (P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.05). Based on independent risk factors identified by multivariate logistic regression, the nomogram model was created. The model produces accurate predictions. If the total nomogram score is greater than 120, there is a 90\% or higher chance of developing DH. In the training and validation sets, the model's ROC curves are 0.762 (95\% CI 0.720‚Äì0.803) and 0.700 (95\% CI 0.623‚Äì0.777), respectively. The calibration curve demonstrates that there is good agreement between the model‚Äôs predictions and the actual outcomes. The decision curve analysis findings demonstrated that the nomogram model was clinically helpful throughout a broad threshold probability range. The DH risk prediction nomogram model constructed in this study can help clinicians identify individuals at high risk for DH at an early stage, which is a guideline for personalized prevention and treatments.},

	abstract = {Background
              Higher levels of physical activity (PA) are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, uncertainty exists on whether the inverse relationship between PA and incidence of CVD is greater at the highest levels of PA. Past studies have mostly relied on self-reported evidence from questionnaire-based PA, which is crude and cannot capture all PA undertaken. We investigated the association between accelerometer-measured moderate, vigorous, and total PA and incident CVD.
            
            
              Methods and findings
              We obtained accelerometer-measured moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity physical activities and total volume of PA, over a 7-day period in 2013‚Äì2015, for 90,211 participants without prior or concurrent CVD in the UK Biobank cohort. Participants in the lowest category of total PA smoked more, had higher body mass index and C-reactive protein, and were diagnosed with hypertension. PA was associated with 3,617 incident CVD cases during 440,004 person-years of follow-up (median (interquartile range [IQR]): 5.2 (1.2) years) using Cox regression models. We found a linear dose‚Äìresponse relationship for PA, whether measured as moderate-intensity, vigorous-intensity, or as total volume, with risk of incident of CVD. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals for increasing quarters of the PA distribution relative to the lowest fourth were for moderate-intensity PA: 0.71 (0.65, 0.77), 0.59 (0.54, 0.65), and 0.46 (0.41, 0.51); for vigorous-intensity PA: 0.70 (0.64, 0.77), 0.54 (0.49,0.59), and 0.41 (0.37,0.46); and for total volume of PA: 0.73 (0.67, 0.79), 0.63 (0.57, 0.69), and 0.47 (0.43, 0.52). We took account of potential confounders but unmeasured confounding remains a possibility, and while removal of early deaths did not affect the estimated HRs, we cannot completely dismiss the likelihood that reverse causality has contributed to the findings. Another possible limitation of this work is the quantification of PA intensity-levels based on methods validated in relatively small studies.
            
            
              Conclusions
              In this study, we found no evidence of a threshold for the inverse association between objectively measured moderate, vigorous, and total PA with CVD. Our findings suggest that PA is not only associated with lower risk for of CVD, but the greatest benefit is seen for those who are active at the highest level.},

              Background
              Objective measures of physical activity (PA) derived from wrist-worn accelerometers are compared with traditional risk factors in terms of mortality prediction performance in the UK Biobank.
            
            
              Method
              A subset of participants in the UK Biobank study wore a tri-axial wrist-worn accelerometer in a free-living environment for up to 7 days. A total of 82 304 individuals over the age of 50 (439 707 person-years of follow-up, 1959 deaths) had both accelerometry data that met specified quality criteria and complete data on a set of traditional mortality risk factors. Predictive performance was assessed using cross-validated Concordance (C) for Cox regression models. Forward selection was used to obtain a set of best predictors of mortality.
            
            
              Results
              In univariate Cox regression, age was the best predictor of all-cause mortality (C = 0.681) followed by 12 PA predictors, led by minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA (C = 0.661) and total acceleration (C = 0.661). Overall, 16 of the top 20 predictors were objective PA measures (C = 0.578‚Äì0.661). Using a threshold of 0.001 improvement in Concordance, the Concordance for the best model that did not include PA measures was 0.735 (9 covariates) compared with 0.748 (12 covariates) for the best model with PA variables (p-value \&lt; .001).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Objective measures of PA derived from accelerometry outperform traditional predictors of all-cause mortality in the UK Biobank except age and substantially improve the prediction performance of mortality models based on traditional risk factors. Results confirm and complement previous findings in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).},

	abstract = {Background
              Despite the well‚Äêestablished capacity of physical activity to reduce blood pressure, the associations between physical activity with cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality in people living with hypertension are not well understood. We examine the dose‚Äêresponse associations of device‚Äêassessed physical activity with all‚Äêcause and CVD mortality and CVD incidence (total, stroke, and coronary heart disease) in adults with hypertension.
            
            
              Methods and Results
              This prospective study included data from 39¬†294 participants with hypertension in the UK Biobank study who had valid accelerometry data and for whom mortality and CVD followed‚Äêup data were available. We categorized moderate‚Äêto‚Äêvigorous physical activity and total physical activity volume into 4 categories based on the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles and used Cox regressions to estimate their associations with CVD mortality and incidence outcomes. Splines were used to assess the dose‚Äêresponse associations. During a median follow‚Äêup of 6.25¬†years (241¬†418 person‚Äêyears), 1518 deaths (549 attributable to CVD) and 4933 CVD (fatal and nonfatal) incident events were registered. Compared with the lowest category of moderate‚Äêto‚Äêvigorous physical activity, the relative risks (hazard ratios and 95\% CIs) of all‚Äêcause mortality for increasing categories were 0.53 (0.46‚Äì0.61), 0.41 (0.34‚Äì0.49), and 0.36 (0.26‚Äì0.49). We found associations of similar magnitude for total CVD incidence, stroke, and coronary heart disease; and for total physical activity volume across all outcomes. For all outcomes, there were linear or nearly linear inverse dose‚Äêresponse relationships with no evidence of harms with high levels of physical activity. Results were robust to removing participants who died within the first 2¬†years.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings underscore the importance of physical activity for people living with hypertension and provide novel insights to support the development of physical activity guideline recommendations for this high‚Äêrisk group.},

              Background
              Physical inactivity is associated with an increased risk of major chronic diseases, although uncertainty exists about which chronic diseases, themselves, might contribute to physical inactivity. The objective of this study was to compare the physical activity of those with chronic diseases to healthy individuals using an objective measure of physical activity.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 96‚Äâ706 participants aged 40‚Äâyears or older from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study (2006‚Äì10). Diagnoses were identified through ICD 9 and 10 coding within hospital admission records and a cancer registry linked to UK Biobank participants. We extracted summary physical activity information from participants who wore a wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer for 7‚Äâdays. Statistical analyses included computation of adjusted geometric means and means using general linear models.
            
            
              Results
              Participants with chronic disease undertook 9\% or 61‚Äâminutes (95\% confidence interval: 57.8‚Äì64.8) less moderate activity and 11\% or 3‚Äâminutes (95\% confidence interval: 2.7‚Äì3.3) less vigorous activity per week than individuals without chronic disease. Participants in every chronic-disease subgroup undertook less physical activity than those without chronic disease. Sixty-seven diagnoses within these subgroups were associated with lower moderate activity.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The cross-sectional association of physical activity with chronic disease is broad. Given the substantial health benefits of being physically active, clinicians and policymakers should be aware that their patients with any chronic disease are at greater health risk from other diseases than anticipated because of their physical inactivity.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Wearable devices can capture unexplored movement patterns such as brief bursts of vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA) that is embedded into everyday life, rather than being done as leisure time exercise. Here, we examined the association of VILPA with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality in 25,241 nonexercisers (mean age 61.8‚Äâyears, 14,178 women/11,063 men) in the UK Biobank. Over an average follow-up of 6.9‚Äâyears, during which 852 deaths occurred, VILPA was inversely associated with all three of these outcomes in a near-linear fashion. Compared with participants who engaged in no VILPA, participants who engaged in VILPA at the sample median VILPA frequency of 3‚Äâlength-standardized bouts per day (lasting 1 or 2‚Äâmin each) showed a 38\%‚Äì40\% reduction in all-cause and cancer mortality risk and a 48\%‚Äì49\% reduction in CVD mortality risk. Moreover, the sample median VILPA duration of 4.4‚Äâmin per day was associated with a 26\%‚Äì30\% reduction in all-cause and cancer mortality risk and a 32\%‚Äì34\% reduction in CVD mortality risk. We obtained similar results when repeating the above analyses for vigorous physical activity (VPA) in 62,344 UK Biobank participants who exercised (1,552 deaths, 35,290 women/27,054 men). These results indicate that small amounts of vigorous nonexercise physical activity are associated with substantially lower mortality. VILPA in nonexercisers appears to elicit similar effects to VPA in exercisers, suggesting that VILPA may be a suitable physical activity target, especially in people not able or willing to exercise.},

	abstract = {Use of wearable devices that monitor physical activity is projected to increase more than fivefold per half-decade1. We investigated how device-based physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and different intensity profiles were associated with all-cause mortality. We used a network harmonization approach to map dominant-wrist acceleration to PAEE in 96,476 UK Biobank participants (mean age 62 years, 56\% female). We also calculated the fraction of PAEE accumulated from moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA). Over the median 3.1-year follow-up period (302,526 person-years), 732 deaths were recorded. Higher PAEE was associated with a lower hazard of all-cause mortality for a constant fraction of MVPA (for example, 21\% (95\% confidence interval 4‚Äì35\%) lower hazard for 20 versus 15‚ÄâkJ‚Äâkg‚àí1‚Äâd‚àí1 PAEE with 10\% from MVPA). Similarly, a higher MVPA fraction was associated with a lower hazard when PAEE remained constant (for example, 30\% (8‚Äì47\%) lower hazard when 20\% versus 10\% of a fixed 15‚ÄâkJ‚Äâkg‚àí1‚Äâd‚àí1 PAEE volume was from MVPA). Our results show that higher volumes of PAEE are associated with reduced mortality rates, and achieving the same volume through higher-intensity activity is associated with greater reductions than through lower-intensity activity. The linkage of device-measured activity to energy expenditure creates a framework for using wearables for personalized prevention.},

	abstract = {Background
              Spending more time active (and less sedentary) is associated with health benefits such as improved cardiovascular health and lower risk of all-cause mortality. It is unclear whether these associations differ depending on whether time spent sedentary or in moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is accumulated in long or short bouts. In this study, we used a novel method that accounts for substitution (i.e., more time in MVPA means less time sleeping, in light activity or sedentary) to examine whether length of sedentary and MVPA bouts associates with all-cause mortality.
            
            
              Methods and findings
              
                We used data on 79,503 adult participants from the population-based UK Biobank cohort, which recruited participants between 2006 and 2010 (mean age at accelerometer wear 62.1 years [SD = 7.9], 54.5\% women; mean length of follow-up 5.1 years [SD = 0.73]). We derived (1) the total time participants spent in activity categories‚Äîsleep, sedentary, light activity, and MVPA‚Äîon average per day; (2) time spent in sedentary bouts of short (1 to 15 minutes), medium (16 to 40 minutes), and long (41+ minutes) duration; and (3) MVPA bouts of very short (1 to 9 minutes), short (10 to 15 minutes), medium (16 to 40 minutes), and long (41+ minutes) duration. We used Cox proportion hazards regression to estimate the association of spending 10 minutes more average daily time in one activity or bout length category, coupled with 10 minutes less time in another, with all-cause mortality. Those spending more time in MVPA had lower mortality risk, irrespective of whether this replaced time spent sleeping, sedentary, or in light activity, and these associations were of similar magnitude (e.g., hazard ratio [HR] 0.96 [95\% CI: 0.94, 0.97;
                P
                {\textless} 0.001] per 10 minutes more MVPA, coupled with 10 minutes less light activity per day). Those spending more time sedentary had higher mortality risk if this replaced light activity (HR 1.02 [95\% CI: 1.01, 1.02;
                P
                {\textless} 0.001] per 10 minutes more sedentary time, with 10 minutes less light activity per day) and an even higher risk if this replaced MVPA (HR 1.06 [95\% CI: 1.05, 1.08;
                P
                {\textless} 0.001] per 10 minutes more sedentary time, with 10 minutes less MVPA per day). We found little evidence that mortality risk differed depending on the length of sedentary or MVPA bouts. Key limitations of our study are potential residual confounding, the limited length of follow-up, and use of a select sample of the United Kingdom population.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              We have shown that time spent in MVPA was associated with lower mortality, irrespective of whether it replaced time spent sleeping, sedentary, or in light activity. Time spent sedentary was associated with higher mortality risk, particularly if it replaced MVPA. This emphasises the specific importance of MVPA. Our findings suggest that the impact of MVPA does not differ depending on whether it is obtained from several short bouts or fewer longer bouts, supporting the recent removal of the requirement that MVPA should be accumulated in bouts of 10 minutes or more from the UK and the United States policy. Further studies are needed to investigate causality and explore health outcomes beyond mortality.},

	abstract = {Importance
              Higher physical activity levels are associated with lower risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, but associations with many common and less severe health conditions are not known. These conditions impose large health care burdens and reduce quality of life.
            
            
              Objectives
              To investigate the association between accelerometer-measured physical activity and the subsequent risk of hospitalization for 25 common reasons for hospitalization and to estimate the proportion of these hospitalizations that might have been prevented if participants had higher levels of physical activity.
            
            
              Design, Setting, and Participants
              This prospective cohort study used data from a subset of 81 717 UK Biobank participants aged 42 to 78 years. Participants wore an accelerometer for 1 week (between June 1, 2013, and December 23, 2015) and were followed up over a median (IQR) of 6.8 (6.2-7.3) years; follow-up for the current study ended in 2021 (exact date varied by location).
            
            
              Exposures
              Mean total and intensity-specific accelerometer-measured physical activity.
            
            
              Main Outcomes and Measures
              Hospitalization for the most common health conditions. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% CIs for mean accelerometer-measured physical activity (per 1-SD increment) and risks of hospitalization for 25 conditions. Population-attributable risks were used to estimate the proportion of hospitalizations for each condition that might be prevented if participants increased their moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) by 20 minutes per day.
            
            
              Results
              Among 81 717 participants, the mean‚Äâ(SD) age at accelerometer assessment was 61.5 (7.9) years; 56.4\% were female, and 97.0\% self-identified as White. Higher levels of accelerometer-measured physical activity were associated with lower risks of hospitalization for 9 conditions: gallbladder disease (HR per 1 SD,‚Äâ0.74; 95\% CI, 0.69-0.79), urinary tract infections (HR per 1 SD, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.69-0.84), diabetes (HR per 1 SD, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.74-0.84), venous thromboembolism (HR per 1 SD, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.75-0.90), pneumonia (HR per 1 SD, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.77-0.89), ischemic stroke (HR per 1 SD, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.76-0.95), iron deficiency anemia (HR per 1 SD, 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.84-0.98), diverticular disease (HR per 1 SD, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.90-0.99), and colon polyps (HR per 1 SD, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.94-0.99). Positive associations were observed between overall physical activity and carpal tunnel syndrome (HR per 1 SD, 1.28; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.40), osteoarthritis (HR per 1 SD, 1.15; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.19), and inguinal hernia (HR per 1 SD, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.19), which were primarily induced by light physical activity. Increasing MVPA by 20 minutes per day was associated with reductions in hospitalization ranging from 3.8\% (95\% CI, 1.8\%-5.7\%) for colon polyps to 23.0\% (95\% CI, 17.1\%-28.9\%) for diabetes.
            
            
              Conclusions and Relevance
              In this cohort study of UK Biobank participants, those with higher physical activity levels had lower risks of hospitalization across a broad range of health conditions. These findings suggest that aiming to increase MVPA by 20 minutes per day may be a useful nonpharmaceutical intervention to reduce health care burdens and improve quality of life.},

Clinical prediction models have become abundant. Pathology measurement or results are frequently included as predictors in such prediction models, certainly in the cancer domain.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prediction models tend to perform better on data on which the model was constructed than on new data. This difference in performance is an indication of the optimism in the apparent performance in the derivation set. For internal model validation, bootstrapping methods are recommended to provide bias-corrected estimates of model performance. Results are often accepted without sufficient regard to the importance of external validation. This report illustrates the limitations of internal validation to determine generalizability of a diagnostic prediction model to future settings.
METHODS: A prediction model for the presence of serious bacterial infections in children with fever without source was derived and validated internally using bootstrap resampling techniques. Subsequently, the model was validated externally.
RESULTS: In the derivation set (n=376), nine predictors were identified. The apparent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95\% confidence interval) of the model was 0.83 (0.78-0.87) and 0.76 (0.67-0.85) after bootstrap correction. In the validation set (n=179) the performance was 0.57 (0.47-0.67).
CONCLUSION: For relatively small data sets, internal validation of prediction models by bootstrap techniques may not be sufficient and indicative for the model's performance in future patients. External validation is essential before implementing prediction models in clinical practice.},

Here, we report on a specific prognostic study on stroke patients and describe how we explored the prediction performance of our model. We considered two practically highly relevant generalization aspects, namely, the model's performance in patients recruited at a later time point (temporal transportability) and in medical centers different from those used for model building (geographic transportability). To estimate the accuracy of the model, we investigated classical internal validation techniques and leave-one-center-out cross validation (CV). Prognostic models predicting functional independence of stroke patients were developed in a training set using logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests (RFs). Tenfold CV and leave-one-center-out CV were employed to estimate temporal and geographic transportability of the models. For temporal and external validation, the resulting models were used to classify patients from a later time point and from different clinics. When applying the regression model or the RFs, accuracy in the temporal validation data was well predicted from classical internal validation. However, when predicting geographic transportability all approaches had difficulties. We observed that the leave-one-center-out CV yielded better estimates than classical CV. On the basis of our results, we conclude that external validation in patients from different clinics is required before a prognostic model can be applied in practice. Even validating the model in patients recruited merely at a later time point does not suffice to predict how it may fare with regard to another clinic.},

Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org).},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches pose a great opportunity for individualized, pre-symptomatic disease diagnosis which plays a key role in the context of personalized, predictive, and finally preventive medicine (PPPM). However, to translate PPPM into clinical practice, it is of utmost importance that AI-based models are carefully validated. The validation process comprises several steps, one of which is testing the model on patient-level data from an independent clinical cohort study. However, recruitment criteria can bias statistical analysis of cohort study data and impede model application beyond the training data. To evaluate whether and how data from independent clinical cohort studies differ from each other, this study systematically compares the datasets collected from two major dementia cohorts, namely, the Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and AddNeuroMed. The presented comparison was conducted on individual feature level and revealed significant differences among both cohorts. Such systematic deviations can potentially hamper the generalizability of results which were based on a single cohort dataset. Despite identified differences, validation of a previously published, ADNI trained model for prediction of personalized dementia risk scores on 244 AddNeuroMed subjects was successful: External validation resulted in a high prediction performance of above 80\% area under receiver operator characteristic curve up to 6 years before dementia diagnosis. Propensity score matching identified a subset of patients from AddNeuroMed, which showed significantly smaller demographic differences to ADNI. For these patients, an even higher prediction performance was achieved, which demonstrates the influence systematic differences between cohorts can have on validation results. In conclusion, this study exposes challenges in external validation of AI models on cohort study data and is one of the rare cases in the neurology field in which such external validation was performed. The presented model represents a proof of concept that reliable models for personalized predictive diagnostics are feasible, which, in turn, could lead to adequate disease prevention and hereby enable the PPPM paradigm in the dementia field.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To improve classification of movement behaviours in free-living accelerometer data using machine-learning methods, and to investigate the association between machine-learned movement behaviours and risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults.
METHODS: Using free-living data from 152 participants, we developed a machine-learning model to classify movement behaviours (moderate-to-vigorous physical activity behaviours (MVPA), light physical activity behaviours, sedentary behaviour, sleep) in wrist-worn accelerometer data. Participants in UK Biobank, a prospective cohort, were asked to wear an accelerometer for 7‚Äâdays, and we applied our machine-learning model to classify their movement behaviours. Using compositional data analysis Cox regression, we investigated how reallocating time between movement behaviours was associated with CVD incidence.
RESULTS: In leave-one-participant-out analysis, our machine-learning method classified free-living movement behaviours with mean accuracy 88\% (95\% CI 87\% to 89\%) and Cohen's kappa 0.80 (95\% CI 0.79 to 0.82). Among 87‚Äâ498 UK Biobank participants, there were 4105 incident CVD events. Reallocating time from any behaviour to MVPA, or reallocating time from sedentary behaviour to any behaviour, was associated with lower CVD risk. For an average individual, reallocating 20‚Äâmin/day to MVPA from all other behaviours proportionally was associated with 9\% (95\% CI 7\% to 10\%) lower risk, while reallocating 1‚Äâhour/day to sedentary behaviour from all other behaviours proportionally was associated with 5\% (95\% CI 3\% to 7\%) higher risk.
CONCLUSION: Machine-learning methods classified movement behaviours accurately in free-living accelerometer data. Reallocating time from other behaviours to MVPA, and from sedentary behaviour to other behaviours, was associated with lower risk of incident CVD, and should be promoted by interventions and guidelines.},

	abstract = {Disruptions of circadian rhythms and sleep cycles are common among neurodegenerative diseases and can occur at multiple levels. Accumulating evidence reveals a bidirectional relationship between disruptions of circadian rhythms and sleep cycles and neurodegenerative diseases. Circadian disruption and sleep disorders aggravate neurodegeneration and neurodegenerative diseases can in turn disrupt circadian rhythms and sleep. Importantly, circadian disruption and various sleep disorders can increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, harnessing the circadian biology findings from preclinical and translational research in neurodegenerative diseases is of importance for reducing risk of neurodegeneration and improving symptoms and quality of life of individuals with neurodegenerative disorders via approaches that normalize circadian in the context of precision medicine. In this review, we discuss the implications of circadian disruption and sleep disorders in neurodegenerative diseases by summarizing evidence from both human and animal studies, focusing on the bidirectional links of sleep and circadian rhythms with prevalent forms of neurodegeneration. These findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and suggest a promising role of circadian-based interventions.},

	abstract = {Non-communicable diseases, including diabetes, are partly responsible for the deceleration of improvements of life expectancy in many countries. Diabetes is also associated with sleep disturbances. Our aim was to determine whether sleep disturbances, particularly in people with diabetes, were associated with increased mortality risk. Data from the UK Biobank were analysed (n¬†=¬†487,728, mean follow-up time¬†=¬†8.9¬†years). The primary exposure was sleep disturbances, assessed through the question: Do you have trouble falling asleep at night or do you wake up in the middle of the night? The primary outcome was mortality. We also dichotomized sleep disturbances into "never/sometimes" versus "usually" (frequently), and combined with the presence/absence of diabetes: 24.2\% of participants reported "never/rarely" experiencing sleep disturbances, 47.8\% "sometimes" and 28.0\% "usually". In age- and sex-adjusted models, frequent sleep disturbances were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-1.37), which remained significant in the fully adjusted model (HR 1.13, 95\% CI 1.09-1.18). The presence of both diabetes and frequent sleep disturbances was associated with greater risk of all-cause mortality than either condition alone. In the fully adjusted model, the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.11 (95\% CI, 1.07-1.15) for frequent sleep disturbances alone, 1.67 (95\% CI, 1.57-1.76) for diabetes alone and 1.87 for both (95\% CI, 1.75-2.01). Frequent sleep disturbances (experienced by more than one quarter of the sample) were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Mortality risk was highest in those with both diabetes and frequent sleep disturbances. Complaints of difficulty falling or staying asleep merit attention by physicians.},

	abstract = {The use of objective measures in epidemiological research may be limited by the cost or inconvenience of obtaining objective measures, which can provide greater insight into links between sleep and health. The importance of sleep and chronobiology for human health has been fully recognized only relatively recently (i.e. within the past two decades). This has delayed the inclusion of related measures in large prospective studies. At its inception in 2006, the UK Biobank study included a number of brief questions related to sleep‚Äîsleep duration, ease of getting up in the morning, chronotype, daytime napping, frequency of sleep disturbances, snoring, and daytime napping. Some self-report measures are remarkably accurate. Chronotype, for example, has been shown to correlate strongly with physiological measures [1] and even the single chronotype question used by the UK Biobank encompasses a heritability which overlaps with and is comparable in magnitude to that of the full questionnaire [2]. By contrast, self-reported sleep duration is notoriously unreliable [3, 4] and inconsistently assessed among studies. This makes the addition of accelerometry data for approximately 100¬†000 UK Biobank participants so valuable, even though it occurred 5 years after baseline. This subsample has previously provided crucial confirmation for GWAS of sleep duration [5, 6]. The UK Biobank dataset has been used in an article published in the present issue [7] to probe associations between mortality (all-cause and cause-specific) and several sleep characteristics, including duration, continuity, and timing of sleep, with an average follow-up time of 6.8 years. This complements a number of previously performed studies with smaller participant numbers [8‚Äì10]. The relationship between sleep duration and mortality had previously been analyzed in the UK Biobank sample [11, 12]. The UK Biobank data confirm a J-shaped curve of mortality versus sleep duration, indicating significantly increased risk of mortality among short sleepers (\&lt;7 hours). This finding first emerged from self-reported data and has been confirmed with the new objective measures in a way that fits with what we know about sleep being imperative to health. Previous research, predominantly based on self-reported sleep duration, observed increased mortality among longer sleepers as well, which has always been controversial since an underlying mechanism remained to be identified. A prior review [3] found that the ‚ÄúU-shape‚Äù was only present in studies that assess sleep duration based on questions asking respondents to report amount of sleep but in studies that used time in bed (i.e. habitual bedtime to habitual wake) did not observe a U-shape. The current study, which used objectively estimated sleep duration, observed no significant associations between long sleep and all-cause or cause-specific mortality, suggesting that self-reported sleep duration may be biased.},

We show gene set enrichments for the axonal part of neurons, cortical and subcortical tissues, and specific cell types, including striatal, hypothalamic, and claustrum neurons. We found considerable genetic correlations with psychiatric traits and sleep duration, and modest correlations with other sleep-related traits. Mendelian randomization identified the causal effects of insomnia on depression, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and the protective effects of educational attainment and intracranial volume.

Additionally, more rhythmic circadian lipids have a significant linear component in addition to the sinusoidal across the 27-h CR in the older group (44/56) compared to the younger group (18/58, p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.0001). Results from individual-level data are consistent with group-average results. Results indicate that prevalence of endogenous circadian rhythms of the human plasma lipidome is preserved with healthy aging into middle-age, but significant changes in rhythmicity include a reduction in amplitude, earlier acrophase, and an altered temporal relationship between central and lipid rhythms.},

	abstract = {Many elderly people complain of disturbed sleep patterns but there is not evidence that the need to sleep decreases with age; it seems rather that the timing and consolidation of sleep change. We tried to find out whether there is a concurrent change in the output of the circadian pacemaker with age. The phase and amplitude of the pacemaker's output were assessed by continuous measurement of the core body temperature during 40 h of sustained wakefulness under constant behavioural and environmental conditions. 27 young men (18-31 years) were compared with 21 older people (65-85 years; 11 men, 10 women); all were healthy and without sleep complaints. The mean amplitude of the endogenous circadian temperature oscillation (ECA) was 40\% greater in young men than in the older group. Older men had a lower mean temperature ECA than older women. The minimum of the endogenous phase of the circadian temperature oscillation (ECP) occurred 1 h 52 min earlier in the older than in the young group. Customary bedtimes and waketimes were also earlier in the older group, as was their daily alertness peak. There was a close correlation between habitual waketime and temperature ECP in young men, which may lose precision with age, especially among women. These findings provide evidence for systematic age-related changes in the output of the human circadian pacemaker. We suggest that these changes may underlie the common complaints of sleep disturbance among elderly people. These changes could reflect the observed age-related deterioration of the hypothalamic nuclei that drive mammalian circadian rhythms.},

	abstract = {Objectives To examine the trajectories of physical activity from preretirement to postretirement and to further clarify whether the changes in physical activity are associated with changes in body weight.
Design Prospective.
Setting French national gas and electricity company (GAZEL cohort).
Participants From the original sample of 20 625 employees, only those retiring between 2001 and 2008 on a statutory basis were selected for the analyses (analysis 1: n=2711, 63\% men; analysis 2: n=3812, 75\% men). Persons with data on at least one preretirement and postretirement measurement of the outcome were selected.
Primary and secondary outcome measures All outcome data were gathered by questionnaires. In analysis 1, the annual prevalence of higher physical activity (walking ‚â•5 km/week) 4 years before and after retirement was analysed. In analysis 2, changes in leisure-time sport activities (engagement, frequency and manner) from preretirement to postretirement were analysed with simultaneous changes in body weight (kilogram).
Results In analysis 1 (n=2711), prevalence estimates for 4 years before and 4 years after retirement showed that higher leisure-time physical activity (walking at least 5 km/week) increased by 36\% in men and 61\% in women during the transition to retirement. This increase was also observed among people at a higher risk of physical inactivity, such as smokers and those with elevated depressive symptoms. In a separate sample (analysis 2, n=3812), change in weight as a function of preretirement and postretirement physical activity was analysed. Weight gain preretirement to postretirement was 0.85 (95\% CI 0.48 to 1.21) to 1.35 (0.79 to 1.90) kg greater among physically inactive persons (decrease in activity or inactive) compared with those physically active (p{\textless}0.001).
Conclusions Retirement transition may be associated with beneficial changes in lifestyle and may thus be a good starting point to preventive interventions in various groups of individuals in order to maintain long-term changes.},

Less is known about the PA of lung cancer patients, and the strong history of smoking could influence pre-diagnosis levels of PA and place them at risk for health problems. This study aimed to compare pre-diagnosis PA and its correlates in patients with lung cancer and other types of cancer (female breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer) and examine the relationship between pre-diagnosis PA and all-cause mortality. Methods: This study used data from the UK Biobank, which is a national cohort study with accelerometry data. We included 2662 participants and used adjusted linear regressions and survival analyses. Results: Male and female lung cancer groups spent a mean of 78 and 91 min/day in pre-diagnosis moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA), respectively; this is lower than the 3 other types of cancer (p {\textless} 0.001). Younger age and faster walking pace had a strong association with PA in all the four types of cancer (p {\textless} 0.01). Smoking status had a strong association with PA in the lung cancer group, while obesity had a strong association with PA in female breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer (p {\textless} 0.01). Higher levels of pre-diagnosis MVPA (‚â•1.5 h/day) were associated with a significantly lower all-cause mortality risk. Conclusions: The present study suggests that lung cancer patients are the most inactive population before diagnosis. The identified difference in correlates of PA suggest that cancer-specific approaches are needed in PA research and practices. This study also highlights the importance of high PA for individuals with high cancer risk.},

The rise of passive monitors to measure participant activity without requiring specific actions opens the possibility for population level analysis. We have developed novel technology for this predictive health monitoring, using limited sensor inputs. In previous studies, we validated these models in clinical experiments with carried smartphones, using only their embedded accelerometers as motion sensors. Using smartphones as passive monitors for population measurement is critically important for health equity, since they are already ubiquitous in high-income countries and increasingly common in low-income countries. Our current study simulates smartphone data by extracting walking window inputs from wrist worn sensors. To analyze a population at national scale, we studied 100,000 participants in the UK Biobank who wore activity monitors with motion sensors for 1 week. This national cohort is demographically representative of the UK population, and this dataset represents the largest such available sensor record. We characterized participant motion during normal activities, including daily living equivalent of timed walk tests. We then compute walking intensity from sensor data, as input to survival analysis. Simulating passive smartphone monitoring, we validated predictive models using only sensors and demographics. This resulted in C-index of 0.76 for 1-year risk decreasing to 0.73 for 5-year. A minimum set of sensor features achieves C-index of 0.72 for 5-year risk, which is similar accuracy to other studies using methods not achievable with smartphone sensors. The smallest minimum model uses average acceleration, which has predictive value independent of demographics of age and sex, similar to physical measures of gait speed. Our results show passive measures with motion sensors can achieve similar accuracy to active measures of gait speed and walk pace, which utilize physical walk tests and self-reported questionnaires.},

	abstract = {Background
Identification of new physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) features relevant for health at older age is important to diversify PA targets in guidelines, as older adults rarely adhere to current recommendations focusing on total duration. We aimed to identify accelerometer-derived dimensions of movement behaviours that predict mortality risk in older populations.

Methods
We used data on 21 accelerometer-derived features of daily movement behaviours in 3991 participants of the UK-based Whitehall II accelerometer sub-study (25.8\% women, 60‚Äì83 years, follow-up: 2012‚Äì2013 to 2021, mean¬†=¬†8.3 years). A machine-learning procedure was used to identify core PA and SB features predicting mortality risk and derive a composite score. We estimated the added predictive value of the score compared to traditional sociodemographic, behavioural, and health-related risk factors. External validation in the Switzerland-based CoLaus study (N¬†=¬†1329, 56.7\% women, 60‚Äì86 years, follow-up: 2014‚Äì2017 to 2021, mean¬†=¬†3.8 years) was conducted.

Findings
In total, 11 features related to overall activity level, intensity distribution, bouts duration, frequency, and total duration of PA and SB, were identified as predictors of mortality in older adults and included in a composite score. Both in the derivation and validation cohorts, the score was associated with mortality (hazard ratio¬†=¬†1.10 (95\% confidence interval¬†=¬†1.05‚Äì1.15) and 1.18 (1.10‚Äì1.26), respectively) and improved the predictive value of a model including traditional risk factors (increase in C-index¬†=¬†0.007 (0.002‚Äì0.014) and 0.029 (0.002‚Äì0.055), respectively).

Interpretation
The identified accelerometer-derived PA and SB features, beyond the currently recommended total duration, might be useful for screening of older adults at higher mortality risk and for diversifying PA and SB targets in older populations whose adherence to current guidelines is low.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spending more time active (and less sedentary) is associated with health benefits such as improved cardiovascular health and lower risk of all-cause mortality. It is unclear whether these associations differ depending on whether time spent sedentary or in moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is accumulated in long or short bouts. In this study, we used a novel method that accounts for substitution (i.e., more time in MVPA means less time sleeping, in light activity or sedentary) to examine whether length of sedentary and MVPA bouts associates with all-cause mortality.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used data on 79,503 adult participants from the population-based UK Biobank cohort, which recruited participants between 2006 and 2010 (mean age at accelerometer wear 62.1 years [SD = 7.9], 54.5\% women; mean length of follow-up 5.1 years [SD = 0.73]). We derived (1) the total time participants spent in activity categories-sleep, sedentary, light activity, and MVPA-on average per day; (2) time spent in sedentary bouts of short (1 to 15 minutes), medium (16 to 40 minutes), and long (41+ minutes) duration; and (3) MVPA bouts of very short (1 to 9 minutes), short (10 to 15 minutes), medium (16 to 40 minutes), and long (41+ minutes) duration. We used Cox proportion hazards regression to estimate the association of spending 10 minutes more average daily time in one activity or bout length category, coupled with 10 minutes less time in another, with all-cause mortality. Those spending more time in MVPA had lower mortality risk, irrespective of whether this replaced time spent sleeping, sedentary, or in light activity, and these associations were of similar magnitude (e.g., hazard ratio [HR] 0.96 [95\% CI: 0.94, 0.97; P {\textless} 0.001] per 10 minutes more MVPA, coupled with 10 minutes less light activity per day). Those spending more time sedentary had higher mortality risk if this replaced light activity (HR 1.02 [95\% CI: 1.01, 1.02; P {\textless} 0.001] per 10 minutes more sedentary time, with 10 minutes less light activity per day) and an even higher risk if this replaced MVPA (HR 1.06 [95\% CI: 1.05, 1.08; P {\textless} 0.001] per 10 minutes more sedentary time, with 10 minutes less MVPA per day). We found little evidence that mortality risk differed depending on the length of sedentary or MVPA bouts. Key limitations of our study are potential residual confounding, the limited length of follow-up, and use of a select sample of the United Kingdom population.
CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that time spent in MVPA was associated with lower mortality, irrespective of whether it replaced time spent sleeping, sedentary, or in light activity. Time spent sedentary was associated with higher mortality risk, particularly if it replaced MVPA. This emphasises the specific importance of MVPA. Our findings suggest that the impact of MVPA does not differ depending on whether it is obtained from several short bouts or fewer longer bouts, supporting the recent removal of the requirement that MVPA should be accumulated in bouts of 10 minutes or more from the UK and the United States policy. Further studies are needed to investigate causality and explore health outcomes beyond mortality.},

	abstract = {Accelerometer-based fitness trackers and smartwatches are proliferating with incessant attention towards health tracking. Despite their growing popularity, accurately measuring hallmark measures of physical activities has yet to be accomplished in adults of all ages. In this work, we evaluated the performance of four machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), to estimate the hallmark measures of physical activities in young (20‚Äì50 years), middle-aged (50‚Äì70 years], and older adults (70‚Äì89 years]. Our models were built to recognize physical activity types, recognize physical activity intensities, estimate energy expenditure (EE) and recognize individual physical activities using wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer data (33 activities per participant) from a large sample of participants (n = 253, 62\% women, aged 20‚Äì89 years old). Results showed that the machine learning models were quite accurate at recognizing physical activity type and intensity and estimating energy expenditure. However, models performed less optimally when recognizing individual physical activities. F1-Scores derived from XGBoost‚Äôs models were high for sedentary (0.955‚Äì0.973), locomotion (0.942‚Äì0.964) and lifestyle (0.913‚Äì0.949) activity types with no apparent difference across age groups. Low (0.919‚Äì0.947), light (0.813‚Äì0.828) and moderate (0.846‚Äì0.875) physical activity intensities were also recognized accurately. The root mean square error range for EE was approximately 1 equivalent of resting EE [0.835‚Äì1.009 METs]. Generally, random forest and XGBoost models outperformed other models. In conclusion, machine learning models to label physical activity types, activity intensity and energy expenditure are accurate and there are minimal differences in their performance across young, middle-aged and older adults.},

In the FinHealth 2017 Survey, a population-based health examination study, 940 participants between 25 and 93 years were instructed to wear an accelerometer (Actigraph GT9X Link) on their non-dominant wrist for 24‚Äâhours on 7 consecutive days. Physical activity information was extracted from 100-Hz triaxial 60-second epoch data as average vector magnitude counts per minute (VM cpm). Results were analyzed by gender, 10-year age-groups, employment status, and education. Hourly means were plotted and compared. Analyses included 915 participants (44\% men) who wore the device at least 10‚Äâhours on 4 or more days, with mean wear time being 149.5‚Äâhours (standard deviation of 615.2‚Äâminutes).Women had higher average VM cpm than men (p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001), with significant gender differences in all age-groups until 65 years and older. Total physical activity was lower with age, unemployment, and retirement, where the hourly patterns mirrored the findings. Our findings agree with previous large-scale wrist-accelerometry data, but extend current knowledge by providing data on gender and socioeconomic variation in physical activity across 24‚Äâhours in a population-based adult sample representing a broad age range.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Few studies have examined how different proportions of moderate and vigorous physical activity affect health outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the proportion of total moderate to vigorous activity (MVPA) that is achieved through vigorous activity is associated with all-cause mortality independently of the total amount of MVPA.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a prospective cohort study with activity data linked to all-cause mortality data from February 1, 2006, through June 15, 2014, in 204,542 adults aged 45 through 75 years from the 45 and Up population-based cohort study from New South Wales, Australia (mean [SD] follow-up,‚Äâ6.52 [1.23] years). Associations between different contributions of vigorous activity to total MVPA and mortality were examined using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for total MVPA and sociodemographic and health covariates.
EXPOSURES: Different proportions of total MVPA as vigorous activity. Physical activity was measured with the Active Australia Survey.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality during the follow-up period.
RESULTS: During 1,444,927 person-years of follow-up, 7435 deaths were registered. Compared with those who reported no MVPA (crude death rate,‚Äâ8.34\%), the adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 0.66 (95\% CI, 0.61-0.71; crude death rate, 4.81\%), 0.53 (95\% CI, 0.48-0.57; crude death rate, 3.17\%), and 0.46 (95\% CI, 0.43-0.49; crude death rate, 2.64\%) for reporting 10 through 149, 150 through 299, and 300 min/wk or more of activity, respectively. Among those who reported any MVPA, the proportion of vigorous activity revealed an inverse dose-response relationship with all-cause mortality: compared with those reporting no vigorous activity (crude death rate,‚Äâ3.84\%) the fully adjusted hazard ratio was 0.91 (95\% CI,‚Äâ0.84-0.98; crude death rate,‚Äâ2.35\%) in those who reported some vigorous activity (but {\textless}30\% of total activity) and 0.87 (95\% CI, 0.81-0.93; crude death rate, 2.08\%) among those who reported 30\% or more of activity as vigorous. These associations were consistent in men and women, across categories of body mass index and volume of MVPA, and in those with and without existing cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among people reporting any activity, there was an inverse dose-response relationship between proportion of vigorous activity and mortality. Our findings suggest that vigorous activities should be endorsed in clinical and public health activity guidelines to maximize the population benefits of physical activity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether vigorous-intensity physical activity confers additional reductions on all-cause and cause-specific mortality compared with moderate-intensity physical activity.
DESIGN: A systematic review (registered in PROSPERO CRD42019138995) and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Three electronic databases up to April 14 2020.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were prospective studies that contained information about (1) moderate-intensity (3-5.9 metabolic equivalent tasks (METs)) and vigorous-intensity (‚â•6 METs) physical activities and (2) all-cause and/or cause-specific mortality. Exclusion criteria were prospective studies that (1) exclusively recruited diseased patients (eg, hypertensive patients and diabetics) or (2) did not account for total physical activity in their multivariable models (3) or did not adjust or exclude individuals with comorbidities at baseline or (4) used physically inactive participants as reference group.
RESULTS: Five studies (seven cohorts using sex-specific results) were pooled into a meta-analysis. For all-cause mortality and controlling by total physical activity, vigorous-intensity physical activity (vs moderate) was not associated with a larger reduction in mortality (HR 0.95, 95\% CI 0.83 to 1.09). After the exclusion of one study judged with critical risk of bias (Risk Of Bias in Non randomized Studies, ROBINS tool) from meta-analysis, results remained similar (HR 0.98, 95\% CI 0.85 to 1.12). Due to the limited number of studies, meta-analyses for cancer and cardiovascular mortality were not performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Prospective studies suggest that, for the same total physical activity, both vigorous-intensity and moderate-intensity physical activities reduce all-cause mortality to the same extent. However, absence of evidence must not be interpreted as evidence of absence due to the existing methodological flaws in the literature.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dose-response relation between physical activity and all-cause mortality is not well defined at present. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the association with all-cause mortality of different domains of physical activity and of defined increases in physical activity and energy expenditure.
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched up to September 2010 for cohort studies examining all-cause mortality across different domains and levels of physical activity in adult general populations. We estimated combined risk ratios (RRs) associated with defined increments and recommended levels, using random-effects meta-analysis and dose-response meta-regression models.
RESULTS: Data from 80 studies with 1‚Äâ338‚Äâ143 participants (118‚Äâ121 deaths) were included. Combined RRs comparing highest with lowest activity levels were 0.65 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 0.60-0.71] for total activity, 0.74 (95\% CI 0.70-0.77) for leisure activity, 0.64 (95\% CI 0.55-0.75) for activities of daily living and 0.83 (95\% CI 0.71-0.97) for occupational activity. RRs per 1-h increment per week were 0.91 (95\% CI 0.87-0.94) for vigorous exercise and 0.96 (95\% CI 0.93-0.98) for moderate-intensity activities of daily living. RRs corresponding to 150 and 300‚Äâmin/week of moderate to vigorous activity were 0.86 (95\% CI 0.80-0.92) and 0.74 (95\% CI 0.65-0.85), respectively. Mortality reductions were more pronounced in women.
CONCLUSION: Higher levels of total and domain-specific physical activity were associated with reduced all-cause mortality. Risk reduction per unit of time increase was largest for vigorous exercise. Moderate-intensity activities of daily living were to a lesser extent beneficial in reducing mortality.},

	abstract = {Background In transitioning from the 7th edition of the tumor-node-metastasis classification (TNM-7) to the 8th edition (TNM-8), colorectal cancer with peritoneal metastasis was newly categorized as M1c. In the 9th edition of the Japanese Classification of colorectal, appendiceal, and anal carcinoma (JPC-9), M1c is further subdivided into M1c1 (without other organ involvement) and M1c2 (with other organ involvement). This study aimed to compare the model fit and discriminatory ability of the M category of these three classification systems, as no study to date has made this comparison. Methods The study population consisted of stage IV colorectal cancer patients who were referred to the National Cancer Center Hospital from 2000 to 2017. The Akaike information criterion (AIC), Harrell's concordance index (C-index), and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the three classification systems. Subgroup analyses, stratified by initial treatment year, were also performed. Results According to TNM-8, 670 (55\%) patients had M1a, 273 (22\%) had M1b, and 279 (23\%) had M1c (87 M1c1 and 192 M1c2 using JPC-9) tumors. Among the three classification systems, JPC-9 had the lowest AIC value (JPC-9: 10546.3; TNM-7: 10555.9; TNM-8: 10585.5), highest C-index (JPC-9: 0.608; TNM-7: 0.598; TNM-8: 0.599), and superior time-dependent ROC curves throughout the observation period. Subgroup analyses were consistent with these results. Conclusions While the revised M category definition did not improve model fit and discriminatory ability from TNM-7 to TNM-8, further subdivision of M1c in JPC-9 improved these parameters. These results support further revisions to M1 subcategories in future editions of the TNM classification system.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study included 13,366 participants with baseline type 2 diabetes from the UK Biobank free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. Lifestyle information was collected through a baseline questionnaire.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.7 years, 1,561 deaths were documented, with 625 from cancer, 370 from CVD, 115 from respiratory disease, 81 from digestive disease, and 74 from neurodegenerative disease. In multivariate-adjusted model, each lifestyle factor was significantly associated with all-cause mortality, and hazard ratios associated with the lifestyle score (scoring 6-7 vs. 0-2 unless specified) were 0.42 (95\% CI 0.34, 0.52) for all-cause mortality, 0.57 (0.41, 0.80) for cancer mortality, 0.35 (0.22, 0.56) for CVD mortality, 0.26 (0.10, 0.63) for respiratory mortality, and 0.28 (0.14, 0.53) for digestive mortality (scoring 5-7 vs. 0-2). In the population-attributable risk analysis, 29.4\% (95\% CI 17.9\%, 40.9\%) of deaths were attributable to a poor lifestyle (scoring 0-5). The association between a healthy lifestyle and all-cause mortality was consistent, irrespective of factors reflecting diabetes severity (diabetes duration, glycemic control, diabetes-related microvascular disease, and diabetes medication).
CONCLUSIONS: A healthy lifestyle was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and mortality due to CVD, cancer, respiratory disease, and digestive disease among individuals with type 2 diabetes.},

Here, we present a wearable multimodal biochip integrated with advanced electrochemical electrodes and multipurpose microfluidic channels that enables simultaneous quantification of multiple sweat indicators, including phenylalanine and chloride, as well as sweat rate. This combined measurement approach reveals a negative correlation between sweat phenylalanine levels and sweat rates among individuals, which further enables identification of individuals at high metabolic risk. By tracking phenylalanine fluctuations induced by protein intake during exercise and normalizing the concentration indicator by sweat rates to reduce interindividual variability, we demonstrate a reliable method to correlate and analyze sweat-blood phenylalanine levels for personal health monitoring.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Studying the role of the immune system in the interaction between mental and physical health is challenging. To study individuals with an intensive, longitudinal study design that requires repetitive sampling in their daily life, non-invasive sampling techniques are a necessity. Urine can be collected in a non-invasive way, but this may be demanding for participants and little is known about fluctuation of inflammatory markers in urine over time. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of non-invasive sampling, and to explore intra-individual differences in inflammatory markers in urine.

Materials \& methods
Ten healthy individuals collected 24-hour urine for 63 consecutive days. In a pilot analysis, 39 inflammatory markers were examined for detectability in urine, stability over time and under storage conditions, and daily fluctuations. Multiplex analyses were used to quantify levels of eight selected markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), Fractalkine, Interleukin-1 receptor-antagonist (IL-1RA), interferon-Œ± (IFNŒ±), interferon-Œ≥ (IFNŒ≥), Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10), Macrophage inflammatory protein-1Œ≤ (MIP-1Œ≤), and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Cross-correlations were calculated between the overnight and 24-hour samples were calculated, to examine whether 24-hour urine could be replaced by the overnight portion for better feasibility. We examined intra- and interindividual differences in the levels of inflammatory markers in urine and the fluctuations thereof.

Results
This study showed that levels of selected inflammatory markers can be detected in urine. Cross-correlation analyses showed that correlations between levels of inflammatory markers in the night portion and the 24-hour urine sample varied widely between individuals. In addition, analyses of time series revealed striking inter- and intra-individual variation in levels of inflammatory markers and their fluctuations.

Conclusion
We show that the assessment of urinary inflammatory markers is feasible in an intensive day-to-day study in healthy individuals. However, 24-hour urine cannot be replaced by an overnight portion to alleviate the protocol burden. Levels of inflammatory markers show substantial variation between and within persons.},

	abstract = {Background/objectives
Current measures of cytokines involve urine, blood or saliva which have drawbacks including circadian rhythm variations and complicated collection methods. Sweat has been used to measure cytokines in young and middle-aged adults, but not older adults. We sought to determine the feasibility of using sweat to measure cytokines in older adults compared to younger adults.
Design
Two visit cross-sectional pilot study stratified by age group.
Setting
Independent living facility and Johns Hopkins University both in Maryland.
Participants
23 community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older and 26 adults aged 18‚Äì40 were included. Those with active cancer treatment or with a known terminal illness diagnosis were excluded.
Measurements
Sweat interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Œ±) were collected using a non-invasive sweat patch worn for 72h by each participant. Samples were measured with a single molecule array (SIMOA) technology for ultrasensitive, multiplexed detection of proteins.
Results
23 older adults and 26 younger adults with mean ages of 77¬±8.0years and 28¬±5.5years, respectively, completed the study. Both groups had high rates of compliance with patch wearing and removal. Higher concentrations of TNF-Œ±, IL-6 and IL-10 were observed in older adults compared to younger adults, which remained significant after controlling for race, sex, body mass index, and chronic disease count (0.110¬±0.030 vs. 0.054¬±0.020pg/mL, 0.089¬±0.012 vs. 0.048¬±0.018pg/mL, and 0.124¬±0.029 vs. 0.067¬±0.025pg/mL, respectively).
Conclusion
These results suggest that sweat patches are a feasible method to collect cytokine data from older adults. Preliminary group differences in cytokine measurement between older and younger groups correspond with current literature that cytokines increase with age, suggesting that sweat measurement using the sweat patch provides a new method of exploring the impact of inflammation on aging. Further research using sweat and the sweat patch is recommended.},

	abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are the most devastating diseases in India and southeast Asia. It is a preventable and curable disease if detected early. Tobacco and alcohol consumption are the two major risk-factors but infection of high-risk HPVs are also associated with development of predominantly oral and oropharyngeal carcinomas. Interestingly, unlike cervical cancer, HPV-induced HNSCCs show good prognosis and better survival in contrast, majority of tobacco-associated HPV‚àíve HNSCCs are highly aggressive with poor clinical outcome. Biomarker analysis in circulatory body-fluids for early cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment monitoring are becoming important in clinical practice. Early diagnosis using non-invasive saliva for oral or other diseases plays an important role in successful treatment and better prognosis. Saliva mirrors the body's state of health as it comes into direct contact with oral lesions and needs no trained manpower to collect, making it a suitable bio-fluid of choice for screening. Saliva can be used to detect not only virus, bacteria and other biomarkers but variety of molecular and genetic markers for an early detection, treatment and monitoring cancer and other diseases. The performance of saliva-based diagnostics are reported to be highly (‚â•95¬†\%) sensitive and specific indicating the test's ability to correctly identify true positive or negative cases. This review focuses on the potentials of saliva in the early detection of not only HPV or other pathogens but also identification of highly reliable gene mutations, oral-microbiomes, metabolites, salivary cytokines, non-coding RNAs and exosomal miRNAs. It also discusses the importance of saliva as a reliable, cost-effective and an easy alternative to invasive procedures.},

	abstract = {Introduction In the European Exposome Project for Health and Occupational Research (EPHOR), a working life exposome toolbox is developed to support evidence-based and cost-effective prevention to improve health at work. Our narrative synthesis showed the potential of using non-invasive sampling for the occupational exposome. This pilot study aims to develop, optimise and validate methods, for collection, storage, detection, and quantification of biomarkers in non-invasive matrices, as alternatives to e.g. whole blood collection via phlebotomy.
Materials and Methods This study was approved by the Ethics Committee Research UZ/KU Leuven (S64599). Nineteen healthy participants were included after filling in informed consent. At two visits to the lab, exhaled breath (EB), EB condensate, lung volumes (spirometry), peripheral blood via phlebotomy, dried blood spots (DBS), saliva and urine were collected and questionnaires were filled in. For a third sampling at home, participants were asked to use instructions for self-sampling of DBS, saliva and urine and bring the samples back to the lab. Each sampling was approximately six months apart. DBS from the first visit and home sampling were stored at room temperature (RT), while those from the second visit were stored at -80¬∞ C until analysis. Saliva was collected by chewing a cotton swab for one minute.
Results By comparing biomarkers in samples of the three timepoints within individuals, we will be able to evaluate the stability and quality of non-invasive samples with different storage times and conditions. We will explore the potential of self-sampling, which can ease sampling in large groups of participants, in shift work, remote areas and during pandemics.
Conclusion This pilot study will allow us to investigate the quality and stability of non-invasive samples, as well as their potential usage in research.EPHOR is funded by the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement number 874703.},

	abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is a cardiovascular disease affecting about 26 million people worldwide costing about \$100 billons per year. HF activates several compensatory mechanisms and neurohormonal systems, so we hypothesized that the concomitant monitoring of a panel of potential biomarkers related to such conditions might help predicting HF evolution. Saliva analysis by point-of-care devices is expected to become an innovative and powerful monitoring approach since the chemical composition of saliva mirrors that of blood. The aims of this study were (i) to develop an innovative procedure combining MEPS with UHPLC-MS/MS for the simultaneous determination of 8-isoprostaglandin F2Œ± and cortisol in saliva and (ii) to monitor lactate, uric acid, TNF-Œ±, cortisol, Œ±-amylase and 8-isoprostaglandin F2Œ± concentrations in stimulated saliva samples collected from 44 HF patients during their hospitalisation due to acute HF. Limit of detection of 10‚Äâpg/mL, satisfactory recovery (95‚Äì110\%), and good intra- and inter-day precisions (RSD‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ10\%) were obtained for 8-isoprostaglandin F2Œ± and cortisol. Salivary lactate and 8-isoprostaglandin F2Œ± were strongly correlated with NT-proBNP. Most patients (about 70\%) showed a significant decrease (a factor of 3 at least) of both lactate and 8-isoprostaglandin F2Œ± levels at discharge, suggesting a relationship between salivary levels and improved clinical conditions during hospitalization.},

This study aims to evaluate the relationship between salivary conductivity and body fluid status during the period of intravenous fluid hydration. Between June 2020 to August 2022, patients presenting with clinical signs of stroke at the emergency department were enrolled. Salivary conductivities were measured before and 3¬†h after intravenous hydration. Patients were considered responsive if their salivary conductivities at 3¬†h decreased by more than 20\% compared to their baseline values. Stroke severity was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and early neurological improvement was defined as a decrease of‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ2 points within 72¬†h of admission. Among 108 recruited patients, there were 35 of stroke mimics, 6 of transient ischemic attack and 67 of acute ischemic stroke. Salivary conductivity was significantly decreased after hydration in all patients (9008 versus 8118¬†¬µs/cm, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.030). Among patients with acute ischemic stroke, the responsive group, showed a higher rate of early neurological improvement within 3¬†days compared to the non-responsive group (37\% versus 10\%, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.009). In a multivariate logistic regression model, a decrease in salivary conductivity of 20\% or more was found to be an independent factor associated with early neurological improvement (odds ratio 5.42, 95\% confidence interval 1.31‚Äì22.5, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.020). Real-time salivary conductivity might be a potential indicator of hydration status of the patient with acute ischemic stroke.},

	abstract = {Sleep is considered essential for the brain and body. A predominant concept is that sleep is regulated by circadian rhythmicity and sleep homeostasis, processes that were posited to be functionally and mechanistically separate. Here we review and re-evaluate this concept and its assumptions using findings from recent human and rodent studies. Alterations in genes¬†that are central to circadian rhythmicity affect not only sleep timing but also putative markers of sleep homeostasis such as electroencephalogram slow-wave activity (SWA). Perturbations of sleep change the rhythmicity in the expression of core clock genes in tissues outside the central clock. The dynamics of recovery from sleep loss vary across sleep variables: SWA and immediate early genes show an early response, but the recovery of¬†non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep follows slower time courses. Changes in the expression of many genes in response to sleep perturbations outlast the effects on SWA and time spent asleep. These findings are difficult to reconcile with the notion that circadian- and sleep‚Äìwake-driven processes are mutually independent and that the dynamics of sleep homeostasis are reflected in a single variable. Further understanding of how both sleep and circadian rhythmicity contribute to the¬†homeostasis of essential physiological variables may benefit from the assessment of multiple sleep and molecular variables over longer time scales.},

	abstract = {Objective There is limited experience regarding the use of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) and JAK inhibitor (JAKi) for the management of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)-induced inflammatory arthritis. We aimed to assess their efficacy and safety in this setting.
Methods Using the Club Rhumatismes and Inflammation French network, we conducted a multicentre, retrospective, observational study of patients with cancer diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis under ICI(s) and treated with bDMARD or JAKi. Clinical data were collected using a standardised case report form.
Results Twenty patients (60\% men, median age 69.5 years) were included, with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-like (n=16), polymyalgia rheumatica-like (n=2) or psoriatic arthritis-like (n=2) clinical presentation. Two patients had pre-existing RA. 90\% were treated with glucocorticoids as first-line therapy and 60\% received methotrexate prior to bDMARD or JAKi. Anti-interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) therapy was used in 13/20 patients (65\%), leading to clinical improvement in 11/13 patients (85\%), but one patient experienced intestinal perforation and cancer progression was noticed in 6/13 patients (46\%). Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were used in 5/20 patients (25\%), with improvement in 4/5 patients (80\%) and cancer progression was observed in 3/5 patients (60\%). Two infections (diverticulitis and pneumonitis) were reported. Anakinra, baricitinib and ustekinumab were each used in one patient. Median duration of the bDMARD or JAKi was 17 weeks.
Conclusion Anti-IL-6R therapy is currently the most common strategy in patients with ICI-induced inflammatory arthritis and insufficient response to glucocorticoids and methotrexate, leading to improvement in {\textgreater}80\%. Overall, cancer progression occurred in about half of patients and whether the bDMARD/JAKi impacted the tumour response remains to be determined.},

	abstract = {Background The close relationship between joints and gut inflammation has long been known and several data suggest that dysbiosis could link spondyloarthritis (SpA) to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The introduction of biological drugs, in particular tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), revolutionised the management of both these diseases. While the impact of conventional drugs on gut microbiota is well known, poor data are available about TNFi.
Aim To investigate the impact of TNFi on gut microbiota.
Methods We evaluated 20 patients affected by enteropathic arthritis, na√Øve for biological drugs, treated with TNFi at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. All patients followed a Mediterranean diet. Patients performed self-sampling of a faecal sample at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. NGS-based ITS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed, followed by the taxonomic bioinformatics analysis.
Results After 6 months of therapy, we detected a remarkable increase in Lachnospiraceae family (Œî +10.3, p=0.04) and Coprococcus genus (Œî +2.8, p=0.003). We also noted a decreasing trend in Proteobacteria (Œî ‚àí8.0, p=0.095) and Gammaproteobacteria (Œî ‚àí9, p=0.093) and an increasing trend in Clostridia (Œî +8.2, p=0.083). We did not find differences between TNFi responders (SpA improvement or IBD remission achieved) and non-responders in terms of alpha and beta diversity.
Conclusions Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that TNFi therapy tends to restore the intestinal eubiosis.},

	abstract = {Objectives A reduced adrenal reserve-associated cortisol production relative to the enhanced needs of chronic inflammation (disproportion principle) has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined the possible clinical value of diurnal cortisol measurements in active RA on treatment response prediction.
Methods Diurnal cortisol production (measured at: 08‚Äì12:00/18:00‚Äì22:00) was assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in 28 consecutive patients with moderately/highly active RA, as well as 3 and 6 months after treatment initiation or/escalation. Twenty-eight COVID-19 patients and 28 age-matched healthy individuals (HC) served as controls.
Results Saliva diurnal cortisol production in patients with RA was similar to that of HC, despite 12-fold higher serum C reactive protein (CRP) levels, and lower than COVID-19 patients (area under the curve: RA: 87.0¬±37.6 vs COVID-19: 146.7¬±14.3, p{\textless}0.001), having similarly high CRP. Moreover, a disturbed circadian cortisol rhythm at baseline was evident in 15 of 28 of patients with RA vs 4 of 28 and 20 of 28 of HC and COVID-19 patients, respectively. Treatment-induced minimal disease activity (MDA) at 6 months was achieved by 16 of 28 patients. Despite comparable demographics and clinical characteristics at baseline, non-MDA patients had lower baseline morning cortisol and higher adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels compared with patients on MDA (cortisol: 10.9¬±4.0 vs 18.4¬±8.2 nmol/L, respectively, p=0.005 and ACTH: 4.8¬±3.3 vs 2.4¬±0.4 pmol/L, respectively, p=0.047). Baseline morning cortisol {\textless}13.9 nmol/L predicted non-MDA at 6 months (75\% sensitivity, 92\% specificity, p=0.006). Prospective measurements revealed that individualised diurnal cortisol production remained largely unchanged from baseline to 3 and 6 months.
Conclusions An impaired adrenal reserve is present in patients with RA. Further studies to confirm that assessment of diurnal cortisol production may be useful in guiding treatment decisions and/or predicting treatment response in RA are warranted.

	abstract = {Objective Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) high impairment. Pain is of paramount importance to be targeted by therapeutical approaches. Our study aim was to perform an add-on device-based non-invasive neuromodulatory treatment through transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) in patients with SSc, assessing its effects on pain as primary endpoint and on inflammation, cardiovascular autonomic control and HRQoL.
Methods Thirty-two patients with SSc were enrolled based on reported pain assessed through Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Twenty-one (90\% with limited cutaneous SSc) completed a randomised, cross-over, patient-blind trial, in which interventional and active control were used in random order for 4 weeks, interspersed with 4 weeks washout. NRS, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29 (PROMIS-29) Item4 for pain interference, heart rate variability (HRV), serum cytokines and HRQoL questionnaires (Health Assessment Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, University of California, Los Angeles Gastrointestinal Tract, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were assessed at baseline, at T1 (after 1 month of tVNS or active control), at T2 (after washout) and at T3 (after 1 month of active control or tVNS). T-test for paired data and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-normally distributed parameters were performed to compare the effect of tVNS and active control.
Results NRS pain was significantly reduced by tVNS and not by active control (Mean¬±SD: ‚àí27.7\%¬±21.3\% vs ‚àí7.7\%¬±26.3\%, p=0.002). Interleukin-6 was downregulated in tVNS versus active control (p=0.029). No significant differences were observed in tVNS versus active control for PROMIS-29 Item4, QoL scales and HRV with both spectral and symbolic analyses.
Conclusion tVNS demonstrated to be a safe and non-invasive add-on tool to reduce pain in SSc.},

	abstract = {Objectives Sensitive detection of joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is crucial to the success of the treat-to-target strategy. In this study, we characterise a novel machine learning-based computational method to automatically assess joint inflammation in RA using thermography of the hands, a fast and non-invasive imaging technique.
Methods We recruited 595 patients with arthritis and osteoarthritis, as well as healthy subjects at two hospitals over 4 years. Machine learning was used to assess joint inflammation from the thermal images of the hands using ultrasound as the reference standard, obtaining a Thermographic Joint Inflammation Score (ThermoJIS). The machine learning model was trained and tuned using data from 449 participants with different types of arthritis, osteoarthritis or without rheumatic disease (development set). The performance of the method was evaluated based on 146 patients with RA (validation set) using Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient, area under the receiver-operating curve (AUROC), average precision, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and F1-score.
Results ThermoJIS correlated moderately with ultrasound scores (grey-scale synovial hypertrophy=0.49, p{\textless}0.001; and power Doppler=0.51, p{\textless}0.001). The AUROC for ThermoJIS for detecting active synovitis was 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.86; p{\textless}0.001). In patients with RA in clinical remission, ThermoJIS values were significantly higher when active synovitis was detected by ultrasound.
Conclusions ThermoJIS was able to detect joint inflammation in patients with RA, even in those in clinical remission. These results open an opportunity to develop new tools for routine detection of joint inflammation.},

	abstract = {C-reactive protein (CRP) is a commonly used marker of systemic inflammation, routinely measured in serum blood samples. However salivary samples offer a non-invasive and easily accessible alternative which would improve point of care (POC) testing for inflammation. Two major challenges restrict the use of saliva: the influence of the oral environment on CRP and its local production; and collecting a standardised sample given patient-dependent salivary flow rates. Here we review the reported studies of salivary CRP in humans as a potential marker of systemic inflammation and how the challenges can be overcome. Salivary CRP currently poorly reflects systemic inflammation as it does not consistently and strongly correlate with serum CRP. The mean and one standard deviation reported R2 values are 0.53‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.23 from 14 studies. An improved understanding of the key challenges and implemented solutions are needed to optimise salivary CRP use. Firstly, control for the effects of local oral inflammation. Screening for oral trauma is one option, however this could drastically limit the number of patients suitable for salivary CRP testing and the number of professionals able to use the POC test. Secondly, the role of a dilution biomarker is considered controlling for salivary flow rate which dilutes serum CRP by {\textasciitilde}104; a variable and likely-patient specific factor. The ideal dilution biomarker should have many of the pharmacokinetic, sensitivity and specificity characteristics of CRP. The potential for positive acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) and negative acute phase protein albumin is considered and the characteristics of any correction function discussed. Currently, however, there are no available strategies to make salivary CRP a reliable quantitative measure of serum CRP and hence POC systemic inflammation testing.},

	abstract = {We aimed to investigate the correlation between serum and salivary concentrations of steroid hormones and IgA, and the variation in concentrations of these biomarkers, across a soccer competitive season in a sample of players playing for an Italian major League team. Thirty-five elite male soccer players were recruited and assessed for salivary hormones (cortisol, testosterone, T/C‚Ä∞ and DHEA-S) and IgA at three different time-points: (t1) after the pre-season period and 16 official matches played; (t2) after a winter break and three official matches played; (t3) 2 days after the final match of the championship and 19 matches played. Players were also tested for blood biomarkers (ser-C, ser-T, ser-T/C‚Ä∞, ser-IgA, ACTH) at two detection times (t1 and t3). Blood samples were collected immediately after saliva sampling. The Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation was used to explore the correlation between blood and salivary concentrations of cortisol, free testosterone and IgA in the different time points. One-way ANOVA and permutation test were performed to explore changes by time of hormones and IgA concentrations over the competitive season. We documented a positive correlation between serum and saliva concentrations for Cortisol at t1 (+58.2\%; p-value = 0.002) and t3 (+54.2\%; p-value = 0.018) and for Testosterone at t1 (+42.0\%; p-value = 0.033). Moreover, a positive variation was documented across the season (D = t3‚Äìt1) for Cortisol (D = +6.83; SEM = ¬±2.70; Var\% = +37.6; p-value = 0.032), Testosterone (D = +0.33; SEM = ¬±0.07; Var\% = +27.3; p-value = 0.002) and DHEA-S (D = +44.48; SEM = ¬±18.54; Var\% = +82.0; p-value = 0.042), while a decrease of sal-T/C ratio and no variation in salivary IgA concentrations were reported.

	abstract = {Several chronic disorders including type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, heart disease and cancer are preceded by a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. Biomarkers for the early assessment of chronic disorders encompass acute phase proteins (APP), cytokines and chemokines, pro-inflammatory enzymes, lipids and oxidative stress mediators. These substances enter saliva through the blood flow and, in some cases, there is a close relation between their salivary and serum concentration. Saliva can be easily collected and stored with non-invasive and cost-saving procedures, and it is emerging the concept to use it for the detection of inflammatory biomarkers. To this purpose, the present review aims to discuss the advantages and challenges of using standard and cutting-edge techniques to discover salivary biomarkers which may be used in diagnosis/therapy of several chronic diseases with inflammatory consequences with the pursuit to possibly replace conventional paths with detectable soluble mediators in saliva. Specifically, the review describes the procedures used for saliva collection, the standard approaches for the measurement of salivary biomarkers and the novel methodological strategies such as biosensors to improve the quality of care for chronically affected patients.},

	abstract = {Background
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects life expectancy. Accelerated biological ageing is thought to be a major risk factor for age-related diseases, but its role in rheumatoid arthritis remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the associations between biological ageing and risk of rheumatoid arthritis and genetic susceptibility to the disease. We also aimed to assess the effect of biological ageing on the life expectancy of people with rheumatoid arthritis.
Methods
We calculated the chronological age-adjusted biological age‚Äîby both the Klemera-Doubal method (KDMAge) and phenotypic age (PhenoAge)‚Äîas a surrogate measure for biological ageing in participants from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank study. KDMAge or PhenoAge acceleration was defined as the residual of the regression of KDMAge or PhenoAge based on chronological age. Participants with accelerated biological ageing had KDMAge or PhenoAge acceleration values greater than 0, whereas those without accelerated ageing had values less than or equal to 0. We did cross-sectional analyses to assess the association between biological ageing and prevalent rheumatoid arthritis in both cohorts and prospective analyses to assess the association between biological ageing and incident rheumatoid arthritis in the UK Biobank. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyse these associations. Polygenic risk scores were used to establish genetic susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis and to analyse the interaction between biological ageing and genetic risk. We also assessed the association between life expectancy and biological ageing status in people with rheumatoid arthritis.
Findings
In the cross-sectional analyses, each 1-year increase in age-adjusted biological age was associated with an increase in the risk of rheumatoid arthritis of between 1\% and 10\%. In the NHANES, individuals with accelerated ageing had a higher risk of rheumatoid arthritis than non-accelerated ageing individuals, with odds ratios of 1¬∑21 (95\% CI 1¬∑03‚Äì1¬∑42; p=0¬∑018) for KDMAge acceleration and 1¬∑46 (1¬∑26‚Äì1¬∑69; p{\textless}0¬∑0001) for PhenoAge acceleration. Similarly, in the UK Biobank, the risk of rheumatoid arthritis was increased in individuals with accelerated ageing compared with individuals with no accelerated ageing (KDMAge odds ratio 1¬∑96 [95\% CI 1¬∑71‚Äì2¬∑24]; PhenoAge 2¬∑71 [2¬∑51‚Äì2¬∑92]). In the prospective analyses of the UK Biobank population, accelerated biological ageing was associated with an increased risk of incident rheumatoid arthritis as measured by both KDMAge (hazard ratio 1¬∑27 [95\% CI 1¬∑03‚Äì1¬∑55]) and PhenoAge (1¬∑70 [1¬∑52‚Äì1¬∑92]). Among participants with high genetic predisposition to rheumatoid arthritis, accelerated biological ageing was associated with an increased risk of incident disease, and we noted significant additive interactions between accelerated biological ageing and genetic risk. At age 45 years, people with rheumatoid arthritis had reduced life expectancy compared with those without rheumatoid arthritis. Among people with rheumatoid arthritis, accelerated biological ageing was associated with reduced life expectancy compared with not having accelerated biological ageing.
Interpretation
Accelerated biological ageing could increase the risk of rheumatoid arthritis, especially among people with high genetic risk, and could reduce the life expectancy of people with rheumatoid arthritis. The identification of populations with accelerated biological ageing has important implications for reducing the risk of rheumatoid arthritis and of lowered life expectancy.

	abstract = {Background
Biological age is a measure of health that offers insights into ageing. The existing age clocks, although valuable, often trade off accuracy and interpretability. We introduce ExplaiNAble BioLogical Age (ENABL Age), a computational framework that combines machine-learning models with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to accurately estimate biological age with individualised explanations.
Methods
To construct the ENABL Age clock, we first predicted an age-related outcome (eg, all-cause or cause-specific mortality), and then rescaled these predictions to estimate biological age, using UK Biobank and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) datasets. We adapted existing XAI methods to decompose individual ENABL Ages into contributing risk factors. For broad accessibility, we developed two versions: ENABL Age-L, based on blood tests, and ENABL Age-Q, based on questionnaire characteristics. Finally, we validated diverse ageing mechanisms captured by each ENABL Age clock through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) association analyses.
Findings
Our ENABL Age clock was significantly correlated with chronological age (r=0¬∑7867, p{\textless}0¬∑0001 for UK Biobank; r=0¬∑7126, p{\textless}0¬∑0001 for NHANES). These clocks distinguish individuals who are healthy (ie, their ENABL Age is lower than their chronological age) from those who are unhealthy (ie, their ENABL Age is higher than their chronological age), predicting mortality more effectively than existing clocks. Groups of individuals who were unhealthy showed approximately three to 12 times higher log hazard ratio than healthy groups, as per ENABL Age. The clocks achieved high mortality prediction power with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0¬∑8179 for 5-year mortality and 0¬∑8115 for 10-year mortality on the UK Biobank dataset, and 0¬∑8935 for 5-year mortality and 0¬∑9107 for 10-year mortality on the NHANES dataset. The individualised explanations that revealed the contribution of specific characteristics to ENABL Age provided insights into the important characteristics for ageing. An association analysis with risk factors and ageing-related morbidities and GWAS results on ENABL Age clocks trained on different mortality causes showed that each clock captures distinct ageing mechanisms.
Interpretation
ENABL Age brings an important leap forward in the application of XAI for interpreting biological age clocks. ENABL Age also carries substantial potential in practical settings, assisting medical professionals in untangling the complexity of ageing mechanisms, and potentially becoming a valuable tool in informed clinical decision-making processes.

	abstract = {Objective
To determine the incidence of epilepsy among Medicare beneficiaries with a new diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia (AD) or Parkinson disease (PD).

Methods
Retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with an incident diagnosis of AD or PD in the year 2009. The 5-year incidence of epilepsy was examined by sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities and neurodegenerative disease status. Cox regression models examined the association of neurodegenerative disease with incident epilepsy, adjusting for demographic characteristics and medical comorbidities.

Results
We identified 178,593 individuals with incident AD and 104,157 individuals with incident PD among 34,054,293 Medicare beneficiaries with complete data in 2009. Epilepsy was diagnosed in 4.45\% (7,956) of AD patients and 4.81\% (5,010) of PD patients between 2009 and 2014, approximately twice as frequently as in the control sample. Minority race/ethnicity was associated with increased risk of incident epilepsy. Among individuals with AD and PD, stroke was associated with increased epilepsy risk. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was associated with increased epilepsy risk for individuals with PD. Depression was also associated with incident epilepsy (AD adjusted hazard ratio (AHR): 1.23 (1.17‚Äì1.29), PD AHR: 1.45 (1.37‚Äì1.54)). In PD only, a history of hip fracture (AHR, 1.35 (1.17‚Äì1.57)) and diabetes (AHR, 1.11 (1.05‚Äì1.18) were also associated with increased risk of epilepsy.

Conclusion
Incident epilepsy is more frequently diagnosed among neurodegenerative disease patients, particularly when preceded by a diagnosis of depression, TBI or stroke. Further studies into the differences in epilepsy risk between these two populations may help elucidate different mechanisms of epileptogenesis.},

The records of 387 ESCC patients receiving curative esophagectomy were retrospectively investigated. The optimal cut-point for LNR was assessed via the best cut-off approach. Potential prognostic parameters were identified through univariate and multivariate analyses. A novel LNR-based TRM stage was proposed. The prognostic discriminatory ability and prediction accuracy of each system were determined using hazard ratio (HR), Akaike information criterion (AIC), concordance index (C-index), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The optimal cut-points of LNR were set at 0, 0{\textasciitilde}0.2, 0.2{\textasciitilde}0.4, and 0.4{\textasciitilde}1.0. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that the LNR category was an independent risk factor of overall survival (P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001). The calibration curves for the probability of 3- and 5-year survival showed good consistency between nomogram prediction and actual observation. The LNR category and TRM stage yielded a larger HR, a smaller AIC, a larger C-index, and a larger AUC than the N category and TNM stage did. In summary, the proposed LNR category was superior to the conventional N category in predicting the prognosis of ESCC patients.},

	abstract = {For modern evidence-based medicine, a well thought-out risk scoring system for predicting the occurrence of a clinical event plays an important role in selecting prevention and treatment strategies. Such an index system is often established based on the subject's 'baseline' genetic or clinical markers via a working parametric or semi-parametric model. To evaluate the adequacy of such a system, C-statistics are routinely used in the medical literature to quantify the capacity of the estimated risk score in discriminating among subjects with different event times. The C-statistic provides a global assessment of a fitted survival model for the continuous event time rather than focussing on the prediction of bit-year survival for a fixed time. When the event time is possibly censored, however, the population parameters corresponding to the commonly used C-statistics may depend on the study-specific censoring distribution. In this article, we present a simple C-statistic without this shortcoming. The new procedure consistently estimates a conventional concordance measure which is free of censoring. We provide a large sample approximation to the distribution of this estimator for making inferences about the concordance measure. Results from numerical studies suggest that the new procedure performs well in finite sample.},

It is an open question whether deep learning methods using automated data integration with minimal pre-processing of mixed data domains such as free text, medical history and high-frequency data can provide discrete-time survival estimates for individual ICU patients. We trained a deep learning model on data from patients admitted to ten ICUs in the Capital Region of Denmark and the Region of Southern Denmark between 2011 and 2018. Inspired by natural language processing we mapped the electronic patient record data to an embedded representation and fed the data to a recurrent neural network with a multi-label output layer representing the chance of survival at different follow-up times. We evaluated the performance using the time-dependent concordance index. In addition, we quantified and visualized the drivers of survival predictions using the SHAP methodology. We included 37,355 admissions of 29,417 patients in our study. Our deep learning models outperformed traditional Cox proportional-hazard models with concordance index in the ranges 0.72‚Äì0.73, 0.71‚Äì0.72, 0.71, and 0.69‚Äì0.70, for models applied at baseline 0, 24, 48, and 72‚Äâh, respectively. Deep learning models based on a combination of entity embeddings and survival modelling is a feasible approach to obtain individualized survival estimates in data-rich settings such as the ICU.

In this study, we developed a deep learning system (DLS) for predicting disease-specific survival for stage II and III colorectal cancer using 3652 cases (27,300 slides). When evaluated on two validation datasets containing 1239 cases (9340 slides) and 738 cases (7140 slides), respectively, the DLS achieved a 5-year disease-specific survival AUC of 0.70 (95\% CI: 0.66‚Äì0.73) and 0.69 (95\% CI: 0.64‚Äì0.72), and added significant predictive value to a set of nine clinicopathologic features. To interpret the DLS, we explored the ability of different human-interpretable features to explain the variance in DLS scores. We observed that clinicopathologic features such as T-category, N-category, and grade explained a small fraction of the variance in DLS scores (R2‚Äâ=‚Äâ18\% in both validation sets). Next, we generated human-interpretable histologic features by clustering embeddings from a deep-learning-based image-similarity model and showed that they explained the majority of the variance (R2 of 73‚Äì80\%). Furthermore, the clustering-derived feature most strongly associated with high DLS scores was also highly prognostic in isolation. With a distinct visual appearance (poorly differentiated tumor cell clusters adjacent to adipose tissue), this feature was identified by annotators with 87.0‚Äì95.5\% accuracy. Our approach can be used to explain predictions from a prognostic deep learning model and uncover potentially-novel prognostic features that can be reliably identified by people for future validation studies.},

	abstract = {Disturbed sleep cycles are the principal cause of institutionalization in dementia, and therefore represent a major clinical problem. They may arise from dysfunction within the circadian clock of the hypothalamus that times and consolidates wakefulness, or from neuropathology in output pathways and/or target sites of the clock specifically controlling sleep and wakefulness. To determine the relationship of disturbed activity cycles to other circadian clock-controlled rhythms, cross-sectional and longitudinal actigraphy and serial sampling of saliva were used to compare the impact of early Alzheimer's dementia on activity/rest and cortisol rhythms in home-dwelling subjects. Mildly demented subjects had daily activity rhythms comparable to those of healthy age-matched subjects. Moderately demented subjects exhibited a range of disturbances of the activity/rest cycle, with reduced stability, increased fragmentation and loss of amplitude. Within the moderately demented group, however, the degree of circadian disruption was not correlated with the individual severity of dementia. All groups of subjects, mild, moderate with normal activity cycles and moderate with abnormal activity cycles, exhibited robust daily profiles of salivary cortisol, with highest levels in the morning (08:00 h) and an evening nadir (20:00-24:00 h). Salivary cortisol levels tended to be higher in the moderately demented subjects in the afternoon, but this effect was not specific to those with abnormal activity/rest patterns. The actimetric data confirm that deterioration of activity/rest cycles is a common and progressive feature in home-dwelling Alzheimer's patients, occurring early in the disease but after the measurable onset of dementia. The maintenance of highly rhythmic daily cortisol profiles in association with disturbed activity profiles, both on an individual and on a group basis, demonstrates that loss of circadian control to activity/rest cycles is not a consequence of global circadian disruption in early dementia. Rather, pathology may develop in discrete elements of the circadian clockwork and/or its output systems that control activity/rest, sleep and wakefulness. Further characterization of this pathology will facilitate more effective management of sleep patterns in home-dwelling demented patients.},

The severely demented group had lower activity mesor, more blunted amplitude, and were more phase delayed (i.e. had later acrophases) than the other group. In addition, the severely demented patients spent less time exposed to bright light. These results confirm that circadian rhythms in nursing-home patients are disturbed with more disturbance in the severely demented. Much of the disturbance may be related not just to age but to mental status.},

Although the detection of blood biomarkers is a standard practice, the use of noninvasive samples (eg saliva) would be beneficial. Aim To investigate the saliva of hospitalized patients with and without sepsis and identify the levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and nitric oxide (NO). Methods Saliva samples were collected from 26 patients in intensive care unit with diagnosis of sepsis and from 26 without sepsis (control). The levels of CRP were determined by using latex agglutination test, whereas those of procalcitonin and IL-6 by ELISA and NO by the Griess reaction. Results Of 26 patients with sepsis, 14 were males (54\%) with a mean age of 63.81 ¬± 3.48 years. The control group had the same distribution for gender, with mean age 65.04 ¬± 4.07 years. Sepsis group showed higher salivary concentrations of CRP, PCT, IL-6 and NO, with only levels of IL-6 being statistically different (P = .0001). Conclusions Patients with sepsis had significantly higher levels of IL-6 in their saliva, suggesting that this biological sample could be useful in the diagnosis of this condition.},

Studies have found that these changes are governed by a biological clock, which in mammals is located in two brain areas called the suprachiasmatic nuclei. The circadian cycles established by this clock occur throughout nature and have a period of approximately 24 hours. In addition, these circadian cycles can be synchronized to external time signals but also can persist in the absence of such signals. Studies have found that the internal clock consists of an array of genes and the protein products they encode, which regulate various physiological processes throughout the body.

	abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is remarkable. Despite numbering only about 10,000 neurons on each side of the third ventricle, the SCN is our principal circadian clock, directing the daily cycles of behaviour and physiology that set the tempo of our lives. When this nucleus is isolated in organotypic culture, its autonomous timing mechanism can persist indefinitely, with precision and robustness. The discovery of the cell-autonomous transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops that drive circadian activity in the SCN provided a powerful exemplar of the genetic specification of complex mammalian behaviours. However, the analysis of circadian time-keeping is moving beyond single cells. Technical and conceptual advances, including intersectional genetics, multidimensional imaging and network theory, are beginning to uncover the circuit-level mechanisms and emergent properties that make the SCN a uniquely precise and robust clock. However, much remains unknown about the SCN, not least the intrinsic properties of SCN neurons, its circuit topology and the neuronal computations that these circuits support. Moreover, the convention that the SCN is a neuronal clock has been overturned by the discovery that astrocytes are an integral part of the timepiece. As a test bed for examining the relationships between genes, cells and circuits in sculpting complex behaviours, the SCN continues to offer powerful lessons and opportunities for contemporary neuroscience.},

Here, we describe circadian disruptions observed in various brain disorders throughout the human lifespan and highlight emerging evidence suggesting these disruptions affect the brain. Currently, much of the evidence linking brain disorders and circadian dysfunction is correlational, and so whether and what kind of causal relationships might exist are unclear.

The AI model can detect PD with an area-under-the-curve of 0.90 and 0.85 on held-out and external test sets, respectively. The AI model can also estimate PD severity and progression in accordance with the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Rating Scale (R‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.94, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.6‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚Äì25). The AI model uses an attention layer that allows for interpreting its predictions with respect to sleep and electroencephalogram. Moreover, the model can assess PD in the home setting in a touchless manner, by extracting breathing from radio waves that bounce off a person‚Äôs body during sleep. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of objective, noninvasive, at-home assessment of PD, and also provides initial evidence that this AI model may be useful for risk assessment before clinical diagnosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The "first-night effect" of polysomnography (PSG) has been previously studied; however, the ability to quantify the sleep disruption level has been confounded with the use of PSG on all nights. We used actigraphy to quantify disruption level and examined characteristics associated with disruption.
METHODS: Totally, 778 older men (76.2¬†¬±¬†5.4 years) from a population-based study at six US centers underwent one night of in-home PSG. Actigraphy was performed on the PSG night and three subsequent nights. Actigraphically measured total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep onset latency (SOL) from the PSG night and subsequent nights were compared. Linear regression models were used to examine the association of characteristics and sleep disruption.
RESULTS: On average, sleep on the PSG night was worse than the following night (p¬†{\textless}¬†0.05, TST 21¬†¬±¬†85¬†min less, SE 2.3 ¬±¬†11.3\% less, WASO 4.9¬†¬±¬†51.8¬†min more, SOL 6.6¬†¬±¬†56.2¬†min more). Sleep on the PSG night was significantly worse than that two and three nights later. Characteristics associated with greater sleep disruption on the PSG night included older age, higher apnea-hypopnea index, worse neuromuscular function, and more depressive symptoms. Minorities and men with excessive daytime sleepiness slept somewhat better on the PSG night.
CONCLUSIONS: Among older men, there was sleep disruption on the PSG night, which may lead to sleep time underestimation. The increase of sleep on the night after the PSG suggests that data from the second monitoring may overestimate sleep.},

	abstract = {Objective: Previous cross-sectional studies have observed alterations in activity rhythms in dementia patients but the direction of causation is unclear. We determined whether circadian activity rhythms measured in community-dwelling older women are prospectively associated with incident dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Activity rhythm data were collected from 1,282 healthy community-dwelling women from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) cohort (mean age 83 years) with wrist actigraphy for a minimum of three 24-hour periods. Each participant completed a neuropsychological test battery and had clinical cognitive status (dementia, MCI, normal) adjudicated by an expert panel approximately 5 years later. All analyses were adjusted for demographics, body mass index (BMI), functional status, depression, medications, alcohol, caffeine, smoking, health status, and comorbidities. Results: After 4.9 years of follow-up, 195 (15\%) women had developed dementia and 302 (24\%) had developed MCI. Older women with decreased activity rhythms had a higher likelihood of developing dementia or MCI when comparing those in the lowest quartiles of amplitude (odds ratio [OR] = 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.09‚Äì2.25) or rhythm robustness (OR = 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.10‚Äì2.26) to women in the highest quartiles. An increased risk of dementia or MCI (OR = 1.83; 95\% CI, 1.29‚Äì2.61) was found for women whose timing of peak activity occurred later in the day (after 3:51 PM) when compared to those with average timing (1:34 PM‚Äì3:51 PM). Interpretation: Older, healthy women with decreased circadian activity rhythm amplitude and robustness, and delayed rhythms have increased odds of developing dementia and MCI. If confirmed, future studies should examine whether interventions (physical activity, bright light exposure) that influence activity rhythms will reduce the risk of cognitive deterioration in the elderly.

By combining individual-level whole genome sequenced data from the UK10K study, and imputed genome-wide genetic data on individuals from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) and the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), a data set of 8810 individuals was assembled; tests of association were performed between autosomal gene-sets of genetic variants and BMD measured at lumbar spine and femoral neck. Distributions of p-values obtained from analyses of a single BMD phenotype are compared to those from the multivariate tests, across several region definitions and variant weightings. There is evidence of increased power with the multivariate test, although no new loci for BMD were identified. Among 17 genes highlighted either because there were significant p-values in region-based association tests or because they were in well-known BMD genes, 4 windows in 2 genes as well as 6 single SNPs in one of these genes showed association at genome-wide significant thresholds with the multivariate phenotype test but not with the single-phenotype test, Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT).},

A smaller sample (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ663) provided actigraphy sleep data. We tested two sleep health composites, based on self-report only and both self-report and actigraphy, across multiple sleep dimensions. We used a weighted sum approach, where higher scores indicated more sleep health problems. Modified Poisson regressions adjusted for sociodemographics and known risk factors. Having more sleep health problems was associated with a higher risk of heart disease using the self-report sleep health composite (aRR‚Äâ=‚Äâ54\%, P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ.001) and the actigraphy/self-report composite (aRR‚Äâ=‚Äâ141\%, P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ.001). Individual sleep dimensions of satisfaction, alertness, and efficiency (from the self-report composite) and regularity, satisfaction, and timing (from the actigraphy/self-report composite) were associated with the risk of heart disease. The effect size of each sleep health composite was larger than the individual sleep dimensions. Race moderated the association between the actigraphy/self-report sleep health composite and heart disease. There was no significant moderation by sex. Findings suggest poorer sleep health across multiple dimensions may contribute to heart disease risk among middle-aged adults.},

	abstract = {Background
Indices quantifying allostatic load (AL) and biological aging (BA) have independently received widespread use in epidemiological literature. However, little attention has been paid to their conceptual and quantitative overlap. By reviewing literature utilizing measures of AL and BA, and conducting comparative analysis, we highlight similarities and differences in biological markers employed and approach toward scale construction. Further, we outline opportunities where both types of indices might be improved by adopting methodological features of the other.

Methods
Using data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (N = 2055, age = 26‚Äì86), we constructed 3 AL indices: 1 common literature standard and 2 alternative formulations informed by previous work with measures of BA. The performance of AL indices was juxtaposed against 2 commonly employed BA indices: Klemera-Doubal Method Biological Age and Homeostatic Dysregulation.

Results
All indices correlated with chronological age. Participants with higher AL and older BA performed worse on tests of physical and subjective functioning. Further, participants with increased life-course risk exposure exhibited higher AL and BA. Notably, alternative AL formulations tended to exhibit effect sizes equivalent to or larger than those observed for BA measures, and displayed superior mortality prediction.

Conclusions
In addition to their conceptual similarity, AL and BA indices also exhibit significant analytical similarity. Further, BA measures are robust to construction using a panel of biomarkers not observed in previous iterations, including carotenoids indexing antioxidant capacity. In turn, AL indices could benefit by adopting the methodological rigor formalized within BA composites, such as applying biomarker down-selection criteria.},

	doi = {10.1001/jama.2014.5616},
	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: In older adults reduced mobility is common and is an independent risk factor for morbidity, hospitalization, disability, and mortality. Limited evidence suggests that physical activity may help prevent mobility disability; however, there are no definitive clinical trials examining whether physical activity prevents or delays mobility disability.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that a long-term structured physical activity program is more effective than a health education program (also referred to as a successful aging program) in reducing the risk of major mobility disability.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study was a multicenter, randomized trial that enrolled participants between February 2010 and December 2011, who participated for an average of 2.6 years. Follow-up ended in December 2013. Outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention assignment. Participants were recruited from urban, suburban, and rural communities at 8 centers throughout the United States. We randomized a volunteer sample of 1635 sedentary men and women aged 70 to 89 years who had physical limitations, defined as a score on the Short Physical Performance Battery of 9 or below, but were able to walk 400 m.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to a structured, moderate-intensity physical activity program (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ818) conducted in a center (twice/wk) and at home (3-4 times/wk) that included aerobic, resistance, and flexibility training activities or to a health education program (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ817) consisting of workshops on topics relevant to older adults and upper extremity stretching exercises.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was major mobility disability objectively defined by loss of ability to walk 400 m.
RESULTS: Incident major mobility disability occurred in 30.1\% (246 participants) of the physical activity group and 35.5\% (290 participants) of the health education group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82 [95\% CI, 0.69-0.98], P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.03).Persistent mobility disability was experienced by 120 participants (14.7\%) in the physical activity group and 162 participants (19.8\%) in the health education group (HR, 0.72 [95\% CI, 0.57-0.91]; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.006). Serious adverse events were reported by 404 participants (49.4\%) in the physical activity group and 373 participants (45.7\%) in the health education group (risk ratio, 1.08 [95\% CI, 0.98-1.20]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A structured, moderate-intensity physical activity program compared with a health education program reduced major mobility disability over 2.6 years among older adults at risk for disability. These findings suggest mobility benefit from such a program in vulnerable older adults.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Walking independently is basic to human functioning. The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) studies were developed to assess whether initiating physical activity could prevent major mobility disability (MMD) in sedentary older adults. METHODS We review the development and selected findings of the LIFE studies from 2000 through 2019, including the planning phase, the LIFE-Pilot Study, and the LIFE Study. RESULTS The planning phase and the LIFE-Pilot provided key information for the successful implementation of the LIFE Study. The LIFE Study, involving 1635 participants randomized at eight sites throughout the United States, showed that compared with health education, the physical activity program reduced the risk of the primary outcome of MMD (inability to walk 400 m: hazard ratio = 0.82; 95\% confidence interval = 0.69-0.98; P = .03), and that the intervention was cost-effective. There were no significant effects on cognitive outcomes, cardiovascular events, or serious fall injuries. In addition, the LIFE studies provided relevant findings on a broad range of other outcomes, including health, frailty, behavioral outcomes, biomarkers, and imaging. To date, the LIFE studies have generated a legacy of 109 peer-reviewed publications, 19 ancillary studies, and 38 independently funded grants and clinical trials, and advanced the development of 59 early career scientists. Data and biological samples of the LIFE Study are now publicly available from a repository sponsored by the National Institute on Aging (https://agingresearchbiobank.nia.nih.gov). CONCLUSIONS The LIFE studies generated a wealth of important scientific findings and accelerated research in geriatrics and gerontology, benefiting the research community, trainees, clinicians, policy makers, and the general public.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is ideally suited to handle, process, and analyze large, dynamic, temporal datasets with multiple intermediary outcomes that are generated during an ART cycle. Here, we review how AI has demonstrated potential for optimization and personalization of key steps in a reproducible manner, including: drug selection and dosing, cycle monitoring, induction of oocyte maturation, and selection of the most competent gametes and embryos, to improve the overall efficacy and safety of ART.},

Real-world clinical datasets and study details from large trials across various medical specialties were presented to ChatGPT ADA without specific guidance. ChatGPT ADA autonomously developed state-of-the-art ML models based on the original study‚Äôs training data to predict clinical outcomes such as cancer development, cancer progression, disease complications, or biomarkers such as pathogenic gene sequences. Following the re-implementation and optimization of the published models, the head-to-head comparison of the ChatGPT ADA-crafted ML models and their respective manually crafted counterparts revealed no significant differences in traditional performance metrics (p‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ0.072). Strikingly, the ChatGPT ADA-crafted ML models often outperformed their counterparts. In conclusion, ChatGPT ADA offers a promising avenue to democratize ML in medicine by simplifying complex data analyses, yet should enhance, not replace, specialized training and resources, to promote broader applications in medical research and practice.},

Until the introduction of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) in March 2023, these LLMs only contained a single mode‚Äîtext.
As medicine is a multimodal discipline, the potential future versions of LLMs that can handle multimodality‚Äîmeaning that they could interpret and generate not only text but also images, videos, sound, and even comprehensive documents‚Äîcan be conceptualized as a significant evolution in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper zooms in on the new potential of generative AI, a new form of AI that also includes tools such as LLMs, through the achievement of multimodal inputs of text, images, and speech on health care‚Äôs future. We present several futuristic scenarios to illustrate the potential path forward as multimodal LLMs (M-LLMs) could represent the gateway between health care professionals and using AI for medical purposes. It is important to point out, though, that despite the unprecedented potential of generative AI in the form of M-LLMs, the human touch in medicine remains irreplaceable. AI should be seen as a tool that can augment health care professionals rather than replace them. It is also important to consider the human aspects of health care‚Äîempathy, understanding, and the doctor-patient relationship‚Äîwhen deploying AI.},

Despite their growing usage, there is a scarcity of comprehensive evaluations of their impact on mental health and well-being. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to fill this gap by synthesizing evidence on the effectiveness of AI-based CAs in improving mental health and factors influencing their effectiveness and user experience. Twelve databases were searched for experimental studies of AI-based CAs‚Äô effects on mental illnesses and psychological well-being published before May 26, 2023. Out of 7834 records, 35 eligible studies were identified for systematic review, out of which 15 randomized controlled trials were included for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that AI-based CAs significantly reduce symptoms of depression (Hedge‚Äôs g 0.64 [95\% CI 0.17‚Äì1.12]) and distress (Hedge‚Äôs g 0.7 [95\% CI 0.18‚Äì1.22]). These effects were more pronounced in CAs that are multimodal, generative AI-based, integrated with mobile/instant messaging apps, and targeting clinical/subclinical and elderly populations. However, CA-based interventions showed no significant improvement in overall psychological well-being (Hedge‚Äôs g 0.32 [95\% CI ‚Äì0.13 to 0.78]). User experience with AI-based CAs was largely shaped by the quality of human-AI therapeutic relationships, content engagement, and effective communication. These findings underscore the potential of AI-based CAs in addressing mental health issues. Future research should investigate the underlying mechanisms of their effectiveness, assess long-term effects across various mental health outcomes, and evaluate the safe integration of large language models (LLMs) in mental health care.},

Results support our model, revealing that inflammation predicts these outcomes even after controlling for factors that may contribute to a spurious linkage between them. Moreover, subsequent analyses revealed that our model was a better fit for the data than alternative models using present-focused decision-making and its health-harming behavioural sequelae (e.g., smoking, risky sexual behaviour) to predict inflammation, lending support for the proposed directionality of this relationship. Together, these results suggest that inflammation may contribute to decision-making patterns that can result in undesirable personal and societal outcomes.},

Synthetic data generation holds the promise of effectively bypassing these boundaries allowing for simplified data accessibility and the prospect of synthetic control cohorts. We employed two different methodologies of generative artificial intelligence ‚Äì CTAB-GAN+ and normalizing flows (NFlow) ‚Äì to synthesize patient data derived from 1606 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, a heterogeneous hematological malignancy, that were treated within four multicenter clinical trials. Both generative models accurately captured distributions of demographic, laboratory, molecular and cytogenetic variables, as well as patient outcomes yielding high performance scores regarding fidelity and usability of both synthetic cohorts (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1606 each). Survival analysis demonstrated close resemblance of survival curves between original and synthetic cohorts. Inter-variable relationships were preserved in univariable outcome analysis enabling explorative analysis in our synthetic data. Additionally, training sample privacy is safeguarded mitigating possible patient re-identification, which we quantified using Hamming distances. We provide not only a proof-of-concept for synthetic data generation in multimodal clinical data for rare diseases, but also full public access to synthetic data sets to foster further research.},

	abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic condition characterized by glucose fluctuations. Laboratory studies suggest that cognition is reduced when glucose is very low (hypoglycemia) and very high (hyperglycemia). Until recently, technological limitations prevented researchers from understanding how naturally-occurring glucose fluctuations impact cognitive fluctuations. This study leveraged advances in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and cognitive ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to characterize dynamic, within-person associations between glucose and cognition in naturalistic environments. Using CGM and EMA, we obtained intensive longitudinal measurements of glucose and cognition (processing speed, sustained attention) in 200 adults with T1D. First, we used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to estimate dynamic, within-person associations between glucose and cognition. Consistent with laboratory studies, we hypothesized that cognitive performance would be reduced at low and high glucose, reflecting cognitive vulnerability to glucose fluctuations. Second, we used data-driven lasso regression to identify clinical characteristics that predicted individual differences in cognitive vulnerability to glucose fluctuations. Large glucose fluctuations were associated with slower and less accurate processing speed, although slight glucose elevations (relative to person-level means) were associated with faster processing speed. Glucose fluctuations were not related to sustained attention. Seven clinical characteristics predicted individual differences in cognitive vulnerability to glucose fluctuations: age, time in hypoglycemia, lifetime severe hypoglycemic events, microvascular complications, glucose variability, fatigue, and neck circumference. Results establish the impact of glucose on processing speed in naturalistic environments, suggest that minimizing glucose fluctuations is important for optimizing processing speed, and identify several clinical characteristics that may exacerbate cognitive vulnerability to glucose fluctuations.},

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted daily routines as in-person school and activities closed to prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to examine and assess differences in objectively measured physical activity levels and sleep patterns from wearable sensors in children with obesity before, during, and after a period of school and extracurricular activity closures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared average step count and sleep patterns (using the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U Test) before and during the pandemic-associated school closures by using data from activity tracker wristbands (Garmin VivoFit 3). Data were collected from 94 children (aged 5‚Äì17) with obesity, who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial testing a community-based lifestyle intervention for a duration of 12-months. During the period that in-person school and extracurricular activities were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, children with obesity experienced objectively-measured decreases in physical activity, and sleep duration. From March 15, 2020 to March 31, 2021, corresponding with local school closures, average daily step count decreased by 1655 steps. Sleep onset and wake time were delayed by about an hour and 45‚Äâmin, respectively, while sleep duration decreased by over 12‚Äâmin as compared with the pre-closure period. Step counts increased with the resumption of in-person activities. These findings provide objective evidence for parents, clinicians, and public health professionals on the importance of in-person daily activities and routines on health behaviors, particularly for children with pre-existing obesity.

	abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease of the central nervous system that is the leading cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults. Clinical laboratory tests and neuroimaging studies are the standard methods to diagnose and monitor MS. However, due to infrequent clinic visits, it is fundamental to identify remote and frequent approaches for monitoring MS, which enable timely diagnosis, early access to treatment, and slowing down disease progression. In this work, we investigate the most reliable, clinically useful, and available features derived from mobile and wearable devices as well as their ability to distinguish people with MS (PwMS) from healthy controls, recognize MS disability and fatigue levels. To this end, we formalize clinical knowledge and derive behavioral markers to characterize MS. We evaluate our approach on a dataset we collected from 55 PwMS and 24 healthy controls for a total of 489 days conducted in free-living conditions. The dataset contains wearable sensor data ‚Äì e.g., heart rate ‚Äì collected using an arm-worn device, smartphone data ‚Äì e.g., phone locks ‚Äì collected through a mobile application, patient health records ‚Äì e.g., MS type ‚Äì obtained from the hospital, and self-reports ‚Äì e.g., fatigue level ‚Äì collected using validated questionnaires administered via the mobile application. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using features derived from mobile and wearable sensors to monitor MS. Our findings open up opportunities for continuous monitoring of MS in free-living conditions and can be used to evaluate and guide the effectiveness of treatments, manage the disease, and identify participants for clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Remote monitoring of cognition holds the promise to facilitate case-finding in clinical care and the individual detection of cognitive impairment in clinical and research settings. In the context of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, this is particularly relevant for patients who seek medical advice due to memory problems. Here, we develop a remote digital memory composite (RDMC) score from an unsupervised remote cognitive assessment battery focused on episodic memory and long-term recall and assess its construct validity, retest reliability, and diagnostic accuracy when predicting MCI-grade impairment in a memory clinic sample and healthy controls. A total of 199 participants were recruited from three cohorts and included as healthy controls (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ97), individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ59), or patients with mild cognitive impairment (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ43). Participants performed cognitive assessments in a fully remote and unsupervised setting via a smartphone app. The derived RDMC score is significantly correlated with the PACC5 score across participants and demonstrates good retest reliability. Diagnostic accuracy for discriminating memory impairment from no impairment is high (cross-validated AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.83, 95\% CI [0.66, 0.99]) with a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.72. Thus, unsupervised remote cognitive assessments implemented in the neotiv digital platform show good discrimination between cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, further demonstrating that it is feasible to complement the neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory with unsupervised and remote assessments on mobile devices. This contributes to recent efforts to implement remote assessment of episodic memory for case-finding and monitoring in large research studies and clinical care.},

We included 50 patients (76.0\% with persistent AF) who underwent catheter ablation with a realistic AF digital twin by integrating computed tomography and electroanatomical mapping. We evaluated the final rhythm status, including AF and atrial tachycardia (AT), across 600 AF episodes, considering factors including PVI level, PVI gap number, and pacing locations. Our findings revealed that antral PVI had a significantly lower ratio of AF at the final rhythm (28\% vs. 56\%, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002) than ostial PVI. Increasing PVI gap numbers correlated with an increased ratio of AF at the final rhythm (p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001). Extra-PV induction yielded a higher ratio of AF at the final rhythm than internal PV induction (77.5\% vs. 59.0\%, p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.001). In conclusion, our human AF digital twin model helped assess AF maintenance mechanisms. Clinical trial registration: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02138695.},

	abstract = {Clinical research relies on high-quality patient data, however, obtaining big data sets is costly and access to existing data is often hindered by privacy and regulatory concerns. Synthetic data generation holds the promise of effectively bypassing these boundaries allowing for simplified data accessibility and the prospect of synthetic control cohorts. We employed two different methodologies of generative artificial intelligence ‚Äì CTAB-GAN+ and normalizing flows (NFlow) ‚Äì to synthesize patient data derived from 1606 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, a heterogeneous hematological malignancy, that were treated within four multicenter clinical trials. Both generative models accurately captured distributions of demographic, laboratory, molecular and cytogenetic variables, as well as patient outcomes yielding high performance scores regarding fidelity and usability of both synthetic cohorts (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1606 each). Survival analysis demonstrated close resemblance of survival curves between original and synthetic cohorts. Inter-variable relationships were preserved in univariable outcome analysis enabling explorative analysis in our synthetic data. Additionally, training sample privacy is safeguarded mitigating possible patient re-identification, which we quantified using Hamming distances. We provide not only a proof-of-concept for synthetic data generation in multimodal clinical data for rare diseases, but also full public access to synthetic data sets to foster further research.},
